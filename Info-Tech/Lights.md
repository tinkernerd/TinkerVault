The are many types of lights with a large array of function and quality. This document aims to become a definitive source of information for anyone looking for quality lights and lighting information. It is not a marketing guide produced by someone who has no theoretical or practical experience.

First a short primer on electricity as it will be helpful later on

Our focus is [LED](led) lights and understanding the general properties of light.

[LED] lights are offered in a variety of formats, which we cover below.

A light source is called **_luminaire_** (traditionally known as a light fixture). A **_luminaire_** is a complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps, together with the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.

The most elementary building block on any [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) lamp is the [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) chip. An [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) lamp consists of one or usually more than one [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) chips. An [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) chip can have various forms like [SMD](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED), [COB](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED).

LEDs work on [VDC](https://portal.habitats.tech/VDC). A driver is always needed to power an [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) as we need to convert [VAC](https://portal.habitats.tech/VAC) to [VDC](https://portal.habitats.tech/VDC). For example an [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) driver takes in 110-240 [VAC](https://portal.habitats.tech/VAC) and outputs

- a fixed amount of current (e.g. 250mA), if it is a constant current driver
- a fixed amount of voltage (e.g. 12[VDC](https://portal.habitats.tech/VDC)), if it is a constant voltage driver

Downlights usually use constant current drivers (e.g. 100/250/500mA) and strip-lights use constant voltage drivers (e.g. 5/12/24[VDC](https://portal.habitats.tech/VDC)).

[LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) strip-lights use current limiting resistors to protect from voltage variations. Voltage variations occur on longer wire lengths and due to change in [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) temperature (higher temperature increases voltage). For example, a small voltage variation of 5% from say 2.74V to 2.87V can create a 100% increase in current say from 350mA to 700mA. Such a substantial increase in current reduces the lifespan of an [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) or even damage it and is called over-driving the [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED).



# Strips

[LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) strip lights are also called linear lights. There reason is they consist of [LED](https://portal.habitats.tech/%F0%9F%93%8CGlossary/Technology/LED) elements in a linear arrangement.
