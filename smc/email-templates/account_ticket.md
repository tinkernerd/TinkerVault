Good [Morning\Afternoon]!

This is [First Name] from the help desk here at Southwestern Michigan College. I just received a ticket that you were having trouble logging into your SMC Wired account. I am more than happy to help you resolve this issue, but this is not something we can do over email due to confidentiality reasons. Please call us at 269-782-1230 for further assistance. Thank you, and have a wonderful day.

Sincerely,

[Worker's name], IT Help Desk
