Good {morning/afternoon},

Here are a few solutions that should fix your issue. If none of these work, please feel free to call the Help Desk at 269.782.1230. Our hours at 8am - 7 pm Monday - Thursday, and 8-5 on Fridays.

1. Close your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Clear your cache and cookies. [Here is a link](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=e934a5cf6fc9a204a3a79b9eae3ee4bf) to explain the process for multiple browsers. Afterward, close your browser.

After completing either step, open your browser again and go to [wired.swmich.edu](https://wired.swmich.edu/).

I hope this helps!

Best regards,
