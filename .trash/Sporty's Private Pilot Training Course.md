## <span id="page-9-0"></span>**4. Introduction to the Airplane**

This section introduces the basic principles of flight, the airplane's controls, and the aerodynamics that make it fly.

The Four Forces of Flight:

- 1. Lift
	- a. Force that acts upward against weight.
	- b. Produced by the wings.
- 2. Weight
	- a. Force caused by gravity acting downward.
- 3. Thrust
	- a. Propels the airplane forward.
	- b. Produced by the engine and propeller.
- 4. Drag
	- a. Force acting opposite to thrust.
	- b. Caused by air resistance.

## How Lift is Produced:

- 1. Bernoulli's Principle
	- a. Increasing the speed of a fluid decreases its pressure.
- 2. Wing Shape
	- a. Upper surface is curved (camber); lower surface is relatively flat.
	- b. Airflow over the top speeds up, decreasing pressure and creating lift.
- 3. Newton's Third Law
	- a. Action-reaction principle.
	- b. Air striking the bottom of the wing is deflected downward.
	- c. The wing pushes air down; air pushes the wing up.
- 4. Total Lift
	- a. Combination of decreased pressure on top and increased pressure below the wing.
- 5. Key Wing Parts
	- a. Leading Edge: Front of the wing.
	- b. Trailing Edge: Back of the wing.
	- c. Chord Line: Imaginary line from leading to trailing edge.
	- d. Upper Camber: Top curve of the wing.
	- e. Lower Camber: Bottom curve of the wing.

#### Axes of Flight and Movements:

- 1. Longitudinal Axis (Roll)
	- a. Runs lengthwise through the fuselage.
	- b. Movement around this axis is called roll or bank.
- 2. Lateral Axis (Pitch)
	- a. Passes through the wings, side to side.
	- b. Movement around this axis is called pitch.
- 3. Vertical Axis (Yaw)
	- a. Runs vertically through the center of gravity.
	- b. Movement around this axis is called yaw.

## Primary Flight Controls:

- 1. Elevator
	- a. Controls pitch (movement around the lateral axis).
	- b. Operated by pushing or pulling the yoke.
	- c. Pulling back moves the elevator up, pitching the nose up.
	- d. Pushing forward moves the elevator down, pitching the nose down.

### 2. Ailerons

- a. Located at the outboard ends of the wings.
- b. Control roll (movement around the longitudinal axis).
- c. Operated by turning the yoke left or right.
- d. Turning yoke right raises right aileron, lowers left aileron; airplane banks right.
- e. Turning yoke left raises left aileron, lowers right aileron; airplane banks left.

## 3. Rudder

- a. Controls yaw (movement around the vertical axis).
- b. Operated by pressing the rudder pedals.
- c. Pushing right pedal moves rudder right, yawing nose right.
- d. Pushing left pedal moves rudder left, yawing nose left.
- e. Used primarily to counteract adverse yaw during turns.

## Adverse Yaw and Coordination:

- 1. Adverse Yaw
	- a. Occurs when deflecting ailerons during turns.
	- b. Down aileron increases lift and drag on that wing.
	- c. This causes the airplane to yaw opposite the turn direction.
- 2. Coordination with Rudder
	- a. Rudder input counters adverse yaw.
	- b. Ensures smooth, coordinated turns.

#### Additional Control Surfaces:

- 1. Trim Tabs
	- a. Used to relieve control pressure on primary control surfaces.
	- b. Attached to trailing edge of elevator, sometimes rudder.
	- c. Elevator trim adjusted in flight; rudder trim often ground-adjustable.

#### 2. Flaps

- a. Located on the inboard trailing edge of wings.
- b. Both flaps extend and retract simultaneously.
- c. Lowering flaps increases wing chord and camber.
- d. Increases both lift and drag.
- e. Allows for steeper, slower approaches during landing.
- f. Can be used to shorten takeoff distance.

Understanding these principles and how to control the airplane is essential for safe and efficient piloting. The natural forces acting on an airplane must be either utilized or counteracted during flight.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>**11. Closer Look: Carbureted Engines**

This section covers the operational differences of carbureted engines in training aircraft, including starting procedures, susceptibility to carburetor icing, and the use of carburetor heat to ensure safe engine operation.

Fuel Primers and Choke Systems

- 1. Many carbureted engines have a fuel primer used during engine start:
	- a. The primer injects fuel directly into the engine cylinders.
	- b. Makes starting easier in cold weather.
	- c. After using the primer, ensure it is closed and locked before takeoff.
- 2. In carbureted "light sport" airplanes:
	- a. A 'choke' control is used for cold starting instead of a primer.
	- b. The choke activates an enriching circuit called a 'starting carburetor' that puts extra fuel into the engine.
	- c. The throttle must be closed for the choke to work effectively.

## Starting Procedures

- 1. Carbureted engines are started with the mixture control in the full-rich position.
- 2. In contrast, fuel-injected engines are started with the mixture control in the idle cutoff position.

## Carburetor Icing

- 1. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing:
	- a. The venturi effect in the carburetor causes a rapid pressure decrease.
	- b. Fuel vaporization reduces air temperature by up to 70°F.
	- c. This cooling can cause water vapor to form frost or ice inside the carburetor, even on hot days.
	- d. Ice formation reduces air and fuel flow, causing lower power and potential engine stoppage.
- 2. Conditions favorable for carburetor icing:
	- a. High humidity or visible moisture.
	- b. Temperatures below 70°F (21°C).
	- c. Especially at low power settings.
- 3. Signs of carburetor icing:
	- a. On engines with fixed pitch propellers, a gradual reduction of RPM at a constant throttle setting.

## Use of Carburetor Heat

- 1. The solution to carburetor ice is the use of carburetor heat:
	- a. Applying carburetor heat increases the engine intake air temperature by diverting air over the exhaust manifold.
	- b. The heated air melts existing ice and prevents further ice formation.
- 2. If carburetor ice is suspected:
	- a. Always apply full carburetor heat immediately.
	- b. The engine may run rough with a further drop in RPM as the ice melts and water enters the cylinders.
	- c. After the ice has melted and water is exhausted, RPM will increase.
- 3. Effects of using carburetor heat when no ice is present:
	- a. A slight drop in engine RPM and power.
	- b. Heated intake air is less dense, reducing the quantity of air available for combustion.
- 4. Routine use of carburetor heat:
	- a. Check carburetor heat during engine run-up before takeoff; expect a small drop in RPM when applied.
	- b. Use carburetor heat when operating at lower RPMs, such as during descent, approach, and landing.
	- c. This is a preventative measure to ensure carburetor ice does not form at reduced throttle settings.

Understanding the operation of carbureted engines, including proper starting procedures and the management of carburetor icing, is essential for safe and efficient flight.

## <span id="page-72-0"></span>**10. Air Facts: Stall Rhetoric**

This section covers the nature of airplane stalls, their characteristics, recovery techniques, and the importance of coordinated flight to ensure safe flying practices.

## Introduction to Stalls

- 1. Some students may feel apprehensive about practicing stalls due to their negative connotation.
- 2. Stalls are transitory and easy to recover from by easing back pressure on the control wheel.
- 3. The loads during a stall are low because the aircraft is flying at a low speed.

### Stall Characteristics and Recovery

- 1. During a stall, the airplane may roll to one side due to yawing movements.
- 2. The ball (slip-skid indicator) will be off-center during a stall.
- 3. To recover from a stall:
	- a. Ease the elevator forward to reduce the angle of attack.
	- b. Level the wings using coordinated use of aileron and rudder.
- 4. Keeping the ball centered during stall entry reduces the tendency to roll.

## Importance of Coordinated Flight

1. Stalling in uncoordinated flight (ball far off-center) can lead to a spin if recovery is delayed.

- 2. In a spin:
	- a. The nose is down, and the aircraft is stalled and flying slowly.
	- b. One wing is more stalled than the other, causing rotation.
- 3. Recovery from a basic spin:
	- a. Reduce power to idle.
	- b. Apply rudder opposite to the direction of spin.
	- c. Relax back pressure on the elevator to reduce the stall.
	- d. Once rotation stops, pull out of the dive smoothly.

## Spins and Spin Recovery

- 1. Most trainers will spin if recovery from an uncoordinated stall is delayed.
- 2. Contemporary airplanes resist spins, and the FAA does not require spin demonstrations for most pilots.
- 3. Students interested in experiencing a spin should seek instruction from an experienced instructor in a spin-approved aircraft.

## Avoiding Unintentional Stalls and Spins

- 1. Stalls and spins are significant safety concerns, especially at low altitudes.
- 2. Many accidents occur during low-level maneuvers or when flying slowly at low altitudes.
- 3. Warning signs of impending stall/spin at low altitude:
	- a. Holding a lot of aileron opposite the direction of turn indicates skidding (uncoordinated flight).
	- b. The ball is not centered.
	- c. Holding excessive back pressure indicates flying slower than trimmed speed.
- 4. Instinctive reaction:
	- a. Move elevator control forward to reduce angle of attack when the airplane feels near a stall.
- 5. The goal is to control airspeed and angle of attack to prevent unintentional stalls or spins.

#### Practice and Developing Instincts

- 1. Practicing stalls at altitude helps develop instinctive recovery reactions.
- 2. While practicing stalls, relax and focus on developing these instincts.

- 3. This training can help prevent problems during actual flight situations.
Remember, the key is to develop an instinctive reaction to recognize and recover from stalls and to maintain coordinated flight to avoid spins. Practicing these maneuvers at altitude builds confidence and safety in flight operations.

## <span id="page-74-0"></span>**11. Normal Landings**

## <span id="page-86-0"></span>**15. Wake Turbulence Avoidance**

This section covers the concept of wake turbulence and practical tips for avoiding it during flight operations.

## Understanding Wake Turbulence:

- 1. Wake turbulence is invisible, caused by a pair of counter-rotating vortices behind an airplane's wingtips, generated whenever a wing is developing lift.
- 2. It becomes hazardous when the airplane rotates for takeoff and ends only upon landing.
- 3. The strength of wake turbulence is determined by:
	- a. Wing shape.
	- b. Speed.
	- c. Weight of the airplane.
- 4. Wake turbulence is strongest behind large, slow airplanes that are taking off or landing.
- 5. The turbulent rolling motion can exceed the control capability of smaller aircraft, posing significant danger.

## Characteristics of Wake Vortices:

- 1. Vortices descend about 400 to 500 feet per minute.
- 2. They level off approximately 900 feet below the flight path of the generating airplane.

## Avoiding Wake Turbulence During Takeoff:

- 1. Visualize the location of the wake turbulence and plan to avoid it.
- 2. When taking off behind a large airplane:
	- a. Observe where the large airplane rotates (lifts off).
	- b. Take off before that point.
	- c. Climb above the large airplane's climb path.
	- d. Turn away from the path of the generating airplane.
	- e. If there is a crosswind, make the turn into the wind.
- 3. For intersection takeoffs:
	- a. Be alert for large airplanes operating nearby.
	- b. Their vortices could drift into your flight path.
- 4. Avoid crossing under a large airplane's flight path.

#### Avoiding Wake Turbulence During Landing:

- 1. When following a large airplane to land on the same runway:
	- a. Stay above its flight path.
	- b. Watch where it touches down.
	- c. Land beyond that point.

	- a. **Normal Category:** Non-acrobatic flight; limit load factor of +3.8G to -1.52G.
	- b. **Utility Category:** Limited acrobatics; limit load factor of +4.4G to -1.76G.
	- c. **Acrobatic Category:** Full acrobatics; limit load factor of +6G to -3G.
- 2. Structures are built to handle 1.5 times the limit load factors for safety margins.
	- a. Exceeding these limits can cause structural damage.

## Effects of Bank Angle on Load Factor:

- 1. In level turns, load factor increases with bank angle due to centrifugal force and gravity.
	- a. 30° bank: Load factor is 1.15G.
	- b. 45° bank: Load factor is 1.41G.
	- c. 60° bank: Load factor is 2G.

## <span id="page-254-0"></span>**2. Air Facts: 6 Rules For Cross Country Flights**

Getting out of the traffic pattern and going on a real trip is a lot of fun. It may even be the reason you're learning to fly in the first place. But the same reasons these trips are so much fun:new places to see, a goal at the end of the flight:can lead to challenges if you aren't prepared.

Here are six rules to keep in mind when you're flying VFR cross countries. They may not be formal regulations, but they're good habits that can keep you safe and comfortable on that big trip.

## Lesson One: Wait for a Sure Thing

- 1. When it comes to weather, don't take off until there's a very good chance of success.
- 2. Avoid the temptation to depart as soon as the weather report shows VFR, especially if you're behind schedule.
- 3. Be patient and wait until the weather trend is clearly in your favor.
- 4. Be honest with yourself:you may not turn around if you encounter marginal conditions after takeoff.

#### Lesson Two: Know the Air Mass

- 1. Determine whether you're flying in a stable or unstable air mass.
- 2. Unstable air masses, especially in summer, can lead to widespread thunderstorms as the day heats up.
- 3. Stable air masses may cause hazy skies but are usually free of convection.
- 4. When in doubt, remember: in summer, it's best to finish flying by noon.

## Lesson Three: Always Have an Out

- 1. Always have a backup plan in case you can't reach your destination.
- 2. This applies to both weather and fuel planning.
- 3. Ensure alternate airports have the necessary services, like fuel, and verify that they will be available when you arrive.
- 4. A little homework ahead of time can really pay off.

### Lesson Four: Slow Down

- 1. If something goes wrong, force yourself to slow down and double-check your last few steps.
- 2. Creating a mental circuit breaker can prevent critical mistakes caused by rushing.
- 3. Accidents have happened because pilots rushed and made errors when out of rhythm.

## Lesson Five: Understand the Terrain

- 1. Consider the effects of terrain on your flight, especially when crossing mountains or flying over foothills.
- 2. Plan a safe altitude above terrain:not just to avoid collisions but also to account for weather interactions.
- 3. Terrain and weather interact in various ways; what's true in the plains may not hold in the hills.
- 4. Be cautious about extrapolating weather conditions between distant airports with different terrains.

### Lesson Six: Use Technology Wisely

- 1. Take advantage of modern technology to make cross-country flying easier and safer.
- 2. Examples include using multi-function displays to see terrain and weather, and utilizing accurate winds aloft forecasts from your phone.
- 3. Be proficient with the technology to prevent it from becoming a distraction.
- 4. Ensure that gadgets are tools, not crutches; maintain your basic stick and rudder skills and be prepared to navigate using pilotage if necessary.

Whether you're flying 1,000 miles to attend a big airshow or just heading to the lake for a family vacation, cross-country flying should be near the top of your aviation to-do list. With a little

preparation and some good discipline, it can be a fun and efficient way to get around.
