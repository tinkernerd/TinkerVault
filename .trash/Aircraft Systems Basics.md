# Key Aircraft Systems

## Powerplant (Engine and Propeller)

### Engine
Provides thrust and powers other aircraft systems.
- Types
	- Reciprocating (piston engines): Common in general aviation.
	- Turbine (jet engines): Found in larger aircraft.

## Systems
- Carbureted or fuel-injected for delivering fuel.
- Air-cooled or liquid-cooled for temperature control.
- **Propeller**
	- Converts engine power into thrust.
	- Fixed-pitch: Simplified, constant blade angle.
	- Variable-pitch: Adjustable blade angle for efficiency.

## Electrical System
- **Components**
	- Battery: Powers systems when the engine is off.
	- Alternator/Generator: Recharges the battery and supplies power during flight.
	- Circuit Breakers: Protect systems from electrical overload.
- **Uses**
	- Powers avionics, lights, and ignition systems.
	- Operates instruments and navigation aids.

## Fuel System
- **Fuel Delivery**
	- Gravity-fed or pump-fed systems.
	- Fuel tanks located in the wings or fuselage.
- **Types of Fuel**
	- AVGAS (Aviation Gasoline) for piston engines.
	- Jet A for turbine engines.
- **Fuel Management**
	- Use proper fuel types and monitor for contamination.
	- Switch tanks to balance fuel during flight.

## Hydraulic System
- **Purpose**
	- Operates high-pressure components like landing gear, flaps, and brakes.
	- Found in larger or more complex aircraft.
- **Components**
	- Pump, reservoir, actuators, and lines.

## Landing Gear System
- **Types**
	- Fixed: Non-retractable and simple.
	- Retractable: Reduces drag for faster flight.
- **Components**
	- Wheels, brakes, and shock absorbers.

## Flight Control System
- **Primary Controls**
	- Ailerons: Control roll.
	- Elevator/Stabilator: Control pitch.
	- Rudder: Controls yaw.
- **Secondary Controls**
	- Flaps: Increase lift or drag for takeoff/landing.
	- Trim: Reduces control pressure for smoother flight.

## Environmental System
- **Cabin Comfort**
	- Heating and cooling systems for temperature control.
	- Pressurization in high-altitude aircraft.
- **Deicing/Anti-Icing**
	- Protects critical surfaces (wings, propeller) from ice buildup.

## Avionics and Navigation Systems
- **Avionics**
	- Radios, transponders, and GPS systems for communication and navigation.
- **Instruments**
	- Basic six-pack: Airspeed, Altimeter, Attitude Indicator, Turn Coordinator, Heading Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator.
