# Daily Note: 2024-09-23

 If it is to be works...fine, but then I must also ask for the legitimate yield I have coming from my works, so that they are meritorious. If it is to be grace--fine, but then I must also ask to be free from works-otherwise it surely is not grace. If it is to be works and nevertheless grace, that is indeed foolishness." Yes, that is indeed foolishness; that would also be true [[Lutheranism]]; that would indeed be Christianity. Christianity's requirement is this: your life should express works as strenuously as possible; then one thing more is required- that you humble yourself and confess: But my being saved is nevertheless grace. The error of the [[MiddleAges]], meritoriousness, was abhorred..
