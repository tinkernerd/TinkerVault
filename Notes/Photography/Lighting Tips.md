# Lighting Tips

Lighting is one of the most important aspects of photography. Here are some tips to help you master it:

- **Natural Light**: Shoot during the golden hour (early morning or late afternoon) for soft, warm light. Avoid harsh midday sunlight.
- **Artificial Light**: Use external flashes or continuous lights to control lighting in your scenes. Adjust the direction and intensity of the light for different effects.
- **Reflectors and Diffusers**: Use reflectors to bounce light onto your subject and diffusers to soften harsh light.
- **Backlighting**: Use backlighting for dramatic silhouettes or to create depth and separation from the background.

Experimenting with light will transform your photos.
