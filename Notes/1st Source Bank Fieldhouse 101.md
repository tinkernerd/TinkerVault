# How to Set Up for Sporting Events

## **Ready in 20 - 45 minutes or less depending  on any technical adjustments or issues**
## **1 - 2 People Needed for A/V Setup**
## **A/V Preparation Starts 1.5 \- 2 hours before event**
1. Pull out both podiums from storage room 835\. Set up podiums as seen in photos below. Lined up next to grey lines on floor as seen in photo below. Lock wheels in place once they are lined up and all cabled are plugged into floor 
2. Test Audio and Video after plugging in ethernet cables labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4\. Power cable and xlr cable into input labeled mic.
   i.e. test mic, pc for music, and other a/v components before doors open for events
3. Final audio checks before doors open for the event. i.e. Check all video boards, buzzers, horns, music from PC, and microphones.
