# Air Traffic Control (ATC)


Air Traffic Control (ATC) ensures the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) by coordinating aircraft movements. Understanding ATC communications, services, and procedures is essential for pilots at every level. This guide provides an overview and links to relevant resources, including the **AIM (Aeronautical Information Manual)**

## Key ATC Concepts for Pilots

## ATC Services
- Clearances
	- Instructions issued by ATC to prevent collisions and manage air traffic flow.
	- Example: “Cleared to land runway 27.”
- Flight Following
	- Advisory service for VFR pilots to enhance situational awareness.
	- Contact Approach or Center frequency.
- Separation
	- ATC ensures horizontal and vertical spacing between aircraft in controlled airspace.

## ATC Facilities
- Tower (TWR)
	- Controls aircraft on the ground and within the airport vicinity.
- Ground (GND)
	- Handles movement on taxiways and aprons.
- Approach (APP) and Departure (DEP)
	- Manages aircraft transitioning to/from enroute airspace.
- Center (ARTCC)
	- Enroute controllers for flights between departure and arrival airspaces.

## ATC Communications
- Phraseology
	- Standardized to ensure clarity and efficiency.
	- Example: “N12345, climb and maintain 5,000.”
- Readbacks
	- Always read back critical information like altitudes and clearances.
- Position Reports
	- Required for IFR pilots at specific points or upon ATC request.

## ATC Equipment and Tools
- Radar
	- Primary tool for tracking and separation.
- ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast)
	- Enhances situational awareness with real-time traffic and weather data.

## Working with ATC
- VFR Pilots
	- Contact ATC for Class B, C, and D airspace entry.
- IFR Pilots
	- Follow ATC-issued clearances at all times.
- Emergencies
	- Declare “Mayday” or “Pan-Pan” as appropriate. ATC is there to help.
