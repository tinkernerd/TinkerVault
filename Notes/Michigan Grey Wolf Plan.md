# Michigan updating gray wolf plan, DNR seeks public input - mlive.com

Among Michigan’s most iconic wildlife species is the gray wolf, an apex predator and largest among wild canines that roam the fields and forests of the Upper Peninsula.

This year state wildlife regulators intend to update the official gray wolf management [plan](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/wolf_management_plan_492568_7.pdf), which set off renewed disagreements about wolf hunting since U.S. fish and wildlife authorities de-listed the species, removing federal protections. The process pits hunting advocates against those who prefer lethal options be kept out of the state’s toolbox and Michigan’s wolf packs be allowed to thrive unchecked.

The state’s large carnivore specialist in the U.P. said before any wolf hunt takes place again, both Michigan’s management plan must be updated, and tribal governments consulted. There’s also a major legal question still hanging.

“The legal status of wolves should be more permanently settled, especially given our long history of legal challenges to these delisting decisions in the past,” said Cody Norton, wildlife biologist for the state Department of Natural Resources.

The previous four attempts to de-list wolves in Michigan were overturned and federal protections resumed for the species. In fact, legal efforts to return wolves to federal protection are currently underway; state Attorney General Dana Nessel last year filed an [amicus brief](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/FILED_Proposed_Brief_-_Wolf_Delisting_Litigation_731090_7.pdf) in litigation against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that alleges federal authorities improperly removed gray wolf endangered species protections.

That’s why rushing into a hunt is not what the DNR wants as gray wolves migrate across the shifting sands of federal status, Norton said.

Michigan had a [wolf hunt in 2013](https://www.mlive.com/news/2013/11/crying_wolf_read_a_digest_of_m.html) during one of the de-listed periods when hunters killed 23 animals.

State wildlife officials last updated the gray wolf plan in 2015, but since 2008 the principal goals of the DNR remained to maintain a viable wolf population, facilitate wolf-related benefits, minimize wolf-related conflicts and conduct “science-based and socially acceptable management of wolves.”

Norton said the DNR wants public comments on the plan and any place improvements can be made through an [online survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=h3D71Xc3rUKWaoku9HIl0QAX0JXc2oZPmVZUlrPcflhUNlhGWFNKRUZRVlhOSTE2WFdLQkwxVFBDRC4u). He said they want input on the long-term health of wolves and the needs of communities, particularly from the remote places of the U.P. where livestock and family pets have been injured or killed by wolves.

The survey is scheduled to be completed by the end of January.

Norton said DNR officials will take public comment, consult with tribal governments, and consider the forthcoming recommendations from the state’s [Wolf Management Advisory Council](https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79137_79763_106230---,00.html) before drafting an updated plan. Then a second public comment period will happen, expectedly later this year.

Nichole Biber, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians citizen and Wolf Preservation Team leader for the Anishinaabek Caucus, said tribal nations assert their treaty rights include a vested interest in how wolves contribute to the environment’s sustained biodiversity.

“It is in in our tribal interests that the cultural and spiritual significance of the wolf be considered a valid factor in decisions regarding the perception and treatment of the species. Our Anishinaabek creation stories, prophecies, ceremonies and clan systems all attest that wolves are sacred among our people,” she said in an email.

“As our teachers about family, ritual, and care, we require their presence for the continuation of our culture. Indeed, one of our central teachings intertwines the fate of the wolf and the Anishinaabek people: what befalls one befalls the other.”

Other political interests are also lining up to add their perspective to the chorus of opinions; the bone of contention remains whether to allow wolf hunting.

Molly Tamulevich, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, said most Michiganders don’t want gray wolves to be killed by hunters and have said so twice during statewide votes. She also argues hunting proponents are determined to reinstate a public wolf hunt, despite the U.P. population of wolves stabilizing and providing ecological benefits.

“When we remove the apex predator from an ecosystem, it does have an impact. It has an impact on the prey species, on the mesopredators, even to the point where it can impact the erosion of rivers of insect biodiversity. So, everything is connected in this. This species has a really key role in our ecosystem here in Michigan,” she said.

Meanwhile, hunting organizations are pressing the issue.

Amy Trotter, executive director of Michigan United Conservation Clubs, occupies one of five seats on the state’s Wolf Management Advisory Council. She said her group wants to see improved transparency and accuracy in how gray wolves are counted by state officials, and to ensure the process stands up to scientific scrutiny.

“One of the things our membership wants to see – and it’s not uniformly desired across the general public, or at least in the anti-hunters and animal advocate groups out there – is to actually set a goal population for wolves in the Upper Peninsula,” Trotter said. “And this is something that we talked about in the past and especially our Upper Peninsula members, and other groups, have said that it would really help to clarify what we’re aiming towards. What are the goals for the for the population, basically.”

U.P. resident and wolf educator Nancy Warren said she hopes the DNR grants greater weight to solid, scientific data about the species and its place in the environment, rather than the political heft of the hunting lobby. She worries politics may win over science.

Warren pointed to a recent [DNR study](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/Factors_Deer_UP_738385_7.pdf) that showed winter weather, changes in deer hunting limits, habitat quality, and predation by other species like black bears and coyotes were proven to limit the size of the deer herd – not just kills by wolves. The data was presented to the advisory council in October.

“Sure enough, the very next meeting, members of council saying ‘We don’t agree with it. We don’t agree with the science,’ yet offered nothing to support why they disagreed with it,” Warren said.

Michigan’s gray wolf population was nearly extirpated by the mid-1970s because of species persecution and active state-sponsored bounty programs. The number of wolves in the state is estimated around 700 animals across the U.P.

Tribal natural resources officials in 2015 [confirmed](https://www.mlive.com/news/2015/09/gray_wolf_confirmed_lower_mich.html) the presence of at least two individual wolves in Emmet County, one of the two most northerly Lower Peninsula counties.

In 2004, a Presque Isle County coyote trapper mistakenly killed a radio-collared female wolf that presumably traveled across an ice bridge from Upper Michigan.
