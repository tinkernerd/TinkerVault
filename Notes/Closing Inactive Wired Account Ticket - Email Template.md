Hello,

It has been two weeks since you submitted a ticket regarding getting into your smc account, so I'm going to go ahead and close the ticket. If you have any questions, or still need help logging into your smc account, please call the SMC Help Desk at (269) 782-1230.

Have a wonderful day,

Nick Stull, IT Help Desk
