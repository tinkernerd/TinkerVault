## üåç Network Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords** ‚Äì Default router passwords should be changed immediately.
2. **Enable Firewalls** ‚Äì Use both hardware and software firewalls for security.
3. **Implement VLANs** ‚Äì Segment networks to isolate sensitive devices.
4. **Disable Unused Ports** ‚Äì Close unnecessary ports to minimize attack surfaces.
5. **Monitor Traffic** ‚Äì Use **Wireshark**, **NetFlow**, or **IDS/IPS** systems to analyze suspicious behavior.
6. **Keep Firmware Updated** ‚Äì Regularly update routers, switches, and firewalls.
