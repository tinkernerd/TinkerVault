**Purpose:**  
In this lab, we will test the physical and chemical properties of a water sample to determine if the body of water is healthy and can support life. Organisms will also be used as indicators of water quality.

**Procedure:**  
Follow the test procedure for each parameter and record results in the data table.  
1. Dissolved Oxygen (DO)  
2. pH  
3. Temperature (°C)  
4. Alkalinity (ppm CaCO3)  
5. Nitrate (ppm)  
6. Phosphate (ppm Orthophosphate)  
7. Turbidity (JTU)

**Healthy Water Parameters:**  
1. DO: Minimum 7 ppm, optimal 10 ppm  
2. pH: Between 6 and 8  
3. Temperature: 13-20°C  
4. Alkalinity: 20-220 ppm  
5. Nitrate/Phosphate: Near zero  
6. Turbidity: Near zero

**Data:**  
**Abiotic** | ppm = parts per million  

| Temperature (°C)               |  12°C   |
| :----------------------------- | :-----: |
| Dissolved Oxygen (ppm)         |  8 ppm  |
| Nitrate (ppm)                  |  0 ppm  |
| Turbidity (JTU)                |  0 JTU  |
| Phosphate (ppm Orthophosphate) |  0 ppm  |
| pH                             |   7.5   |
| Alkalinity (ppm CaCO3)         | 185 ppm |

**Biotic (organisms collected):**  
Biotic Index Value: 2.5 (Calculated using biotic index handout)

**Questions:**

1. **Percent saturation is the amount of oxygen in a liter of water relative to the total amount of oxygen that the water can hold at that temperature. Using the Nomograph of Oxygen Saturation, estimate the percent saturation of dissolved oxygen (DO) in your sample.**  
   **Answer:** 55%

2. **Besides temperature, what are other factors measured today that can affect DO levels? Explain how they alter the amount of DO in a body of water.**  
   **Answer:** pH, nitrates, phosphates, and turbidity can affect DO levels. High nitrate or phosphate levels promote algae growth, which depletes oxygen as algae decomposes (eutrophication). Low pH can stress aquatic life, reducing oxygen demand, while high turbidity limits light penetration, affecting photosynthesis and oxygen production.

3. **Compare the class results for your abiotic data to the values listed above for a healthy body of water. Explain how each one compares.**  
   **Answer:** The dissolved oxygen is above the minimum requirement of 7 ppm (our sample has 8 ppm). The pH is within the healthy range at 7.5. Temperature is slightly lower than the ideal range but still acceptable. Alkalinity is well within the healthy range at 185 ppm. Nitrate and phosphate are at zero, and turbidity is at zero as well. Overall, the water appears healthy.

4. **Based on your comparison in #3 for your abiotic data, would you say that this body of water is healthy? Explain.**  
   **Answer:** Yes, based on the abiotic data, this body of water meets the criteria for healthy water and should be able to support aquatic life. All parameters fall within or close to the recommended ranges.

5. **What is your biotic index value? Does your biotic index value support the conclusion you reached regarding your abiotic data in question #3? Explain.**  
   **Answer:** The biotic index value is 2.5, which indicates good water quality. This supports the conclusion from the abiotic data that the water is healthy and able to support aquatic life.
