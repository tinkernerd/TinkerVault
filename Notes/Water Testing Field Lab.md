**Water Testing Lab**  
   
***Questions:***

1. Percent saturation is the amount of oxygen in a liter of water relative to the total amount of oxygen that the water can hold at that temperature.  Using the Nomograph of Oxygen Saturation, estimate the percent saturation of dissolved oxygen (DO) in your sample.  
- % saturation = 95%  
2. Besides temperature, what are other factors measured today can affect DO levels.  EXPLAIN how they alter the amount of DO in a body of water.  
- Besides temperature, other factors that can affect dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in water include salinity, pressure, and the presence of plants or algae. Higher salinity, like in seawater, lowers the amount of oxygen that can dissolve because salt reduces waterâ€™s ability to hold gases. Pressure also plays a role; in deeper waters, increased pressure can help dissolve more oxygen, but at the surface, where pressure is lower, less oxygen stays in the water. Additionally, plants and algae can either increase or decrease oxygen levels. During the day, they produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but at night, they consume oxygen during respiration, which can lower DO levels.  
3. Compare the class results to the values listed above for a healthy body of water.  Explain how each one compares.  
   There were no class results
