Our Digital signage is capable of alerts, video playback w/ audio, announcements (PA System), and generic digital signage. Yodeck and Google Slides are our backbone infrastructures where you can build widgets, slides, timed events, announcements, and alerts. The credentials for Yodeck and the Google Slides are held by Lyndon Parrish (Head of Security), Michelle Orlaske (Head of Marketing), and Joshua Bennett (IT Technician and Raspberry Pi Guy). Here are some informational videos to get started:

1.  [Yodeck Step-By-Step Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6uTez-0n3yHlv87YmZSVzF60AKa_C2QU)

&&

1.  Click the folder that corresponds with your campus location (for this example we'll use Dowagiac)
2.  Click the corresponding building (in this example we'll click Briegel)
3.  Open the Digital Sign you would like to edit (right now, for Briegel we have only one)
4.  Make changes as you wish in the google slide, changes will take effect on the monitor at 8:00 PM daily (if changes need to be instantaneous for dire reasons, call beaksquad)
-   Optional: To implement a Power Point into this instead of editing from Google Slides, delete all (or at least the slides you no longer want), do this by clicking the slide and hitting the delete key
-   Next go to 'File' and click 'Import Slides'
-   click 'Upload'
-   Drag and Drop the Power Point File into the 'Drag a file here' section
-   Select all slides you wish to put into google slides
-   Then click 'Import Slides'
-   The slides should now be in the right place
-   Reminder, the formatting may change as a result of putting a Power Point into Google Slides
-   Now every day at 8:00PM the slides will update, otherwise if needed to be changed right away call Beaksquad.
For Alerts: <https://www.yodeck.com/docs/user-manual/emergency-alerts-on-screen/>
It is partially complete, though I was told to stop working on it as it wasn't really what we were looking for, but now Lyndon is expressing interest again.
We do have some google slides to present for such alerts and a layout in yodeck for them, they just need to be attached to the monitors, details are in the webpage listed above.
