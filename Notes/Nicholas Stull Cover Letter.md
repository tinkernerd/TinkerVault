To Mr.Valeris,

This letter accompanies my application for the Help Desk Supervisor/Technical Support Specialist part time position with Southwestern Michigan College. I bring nearly three years of experience working at the Help Desk as a student worker, combined with my previous background in customer support.  Additionally, I have experience in technology from my involvement in First Robotics during high school and an educational experience in a Cisco technology class before continuing at SMC towards an Associate Degree in IT Networking.

According to the job listing, an associate degree or Comptia A+ is required. I am on track to complete my associate degree by the end of the fall semester and I hold a CompTIA A+ Certification, which I have included. I am also currently working to complete my CompTIA Security+ Certification as well within the year. I have experience with Active Directory, Windows 10 and 11, Linux, macOS, networking (DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP), and documentation. I am prepared to discuss any specific skills or experiences relevant to the job requirements in further detail.

I maintain a home lab setup that has given me hands-on experience with various aspects of network operations, including managing routers, switches, and overall technology maintenance. This, combined with my academic and professional experience at Southwestern Michigan College, makes me confident in my ability to excel within the new position.

I am passionate about continuous learning, whether in the classroom, on the job, or through exploring new and exciting technologies and security advancements. I am dedicated to delivering the best performance possible and committed to completing any project I undertake. One aspect I pride myself on is my ability to productively read documentation for areas I am not fully proficient in, as well as create clear and concise documentation for projects I am working on. 

Thank you for considering my application. Feel free to text, call, or email with any questions. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute further to your team within the Southwestern Michigan College IT Department.

Sincerely, 

**Nicholas Stull**
