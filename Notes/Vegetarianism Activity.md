# Does What We Eat Matter?

### Part 1: Impacts of an Animal-Based Diet on the Environment

#### 1. What is vegetarianism?

Vegetarianism is a dietary choice where a person avoids consuming meat, including beef, poultry, and seafood. Vegetarians often rely on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes as the core of their diet.

#### 2. Provide a few reasons why someone may choose to be a vegetarian.

People may choose to be vegetarians for various reasons. These include health concerns, ethical beliefs about animal rights, religious reasons, or environmental concerns. Some people believe that a vegetarian diet is more sustainable and better for the planet.

#### 3. The reading provides six impacts of an animal-based diet on the environment. Provide all six along with a brief explanation of the concern related to it.

The six impacts of an animal-based diet on the environment include:

1. **Water Resources**: Animal farming requires large amounts of water, both for the animals and the crops needed to feed them. This leads to water depletion and pollution.
   
2. **Energy Consumption**: Producing meat requires more energy compared to plant-based foods, mainly due to the need for feed production and animal processing.
   
3. **Chemical Fertilizer Use**: Animal farming relies heavily on fertilizers to grow feed crops, which can lead to soil and water contamination.
   
4. **Pesticide Use**: The use of pesticides to protect feed crops can contaminate water supplies and harm non-target species.
   
5. **Waste Generation**: Animals produce large amounts of waste that can pollute water, air, and soil, contributing to environmental degradation.
   
6. **Land Degradation**: Raising livestock requires vast amounts of land, contributing to deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.

#### 4. Based on what you know and what you have read, does what you eat matter? Explain.

Yes, what we eat does matter. The research shows that an animal-based diet has significant environmental impacts, including higher water usage, energy consumption, and pollution. Choosing a more plant-based diet can reduce these impacts and help create a more sustainable world. By making conscious dietary choices, individuals can contribute to lessening the ecological footprint.
