# Does What We Eat Matter?

### Part 1: Impacts of an Animal-Based Diet on the Environment

#### 1. What is vegetarianism?

Vegetarianism is a dietary choice where a person avoids consuming meat, including beef, poultry, and seafood. Vegetarians often rely on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes as the core of their diet.

#### 2. Provide a few reasons why someone may choose to be a vegetarian.

People may choose to be vegetarians for various reasons. These include health concerns, ethical beliefs about animal rights, religious reasons, or environmental concerns. Some people believe that a vegetarian diet is more sustainable and better for the planet.

#### 3. The reading provides six impacts of an animal-based diet on the environment. Provide all six along with a brief explanation of the concern related to it.

The six impacts of an animal-based diet on the environment include:

1. **Water Resources**: Animal farming requires large amounts of water, both for the animals and the crops needed to feed them. This leads to water depletion and pollution.
   
2. **Energy Consumption**: Producing meat requires more energy compared to plant-based foods, mainly due to the need for feed production and animal processing.
   
3. **Chemical Fertilizer Use**: Animal farming relies heavily on fertilizers to grow feed crops, which can lead to soil and water contamination.
   
4. **Pesticide Use**: The use of pesticides to protect feed crops can contaminate water supplies and harm non-target species.
   
5. **Waste Generation**: Animals produce large amounts of waste that can pollute water, air, and soil, contributing to environmental degradation.
   
6. **Land Degradation**: Raising livestock requires vast amounts of land, contributing to deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.

#### 4. Based on what you know and what you have read, does what you eat matter? Explain.

Yes, what we eat does matter. The research shows that an animal-based diet has significant environmental impacts, including higher water usage, energy consumption, and pollution. Choosing a more plant-based diet can reduce these impacts and help create a more sustainable world. By making conscious dietary choices, individuals can contribute to lessening the ecological footprint.

#### 5. What does the manufacturer of “Impossible” foods claim are the human health benefits of consuming these foods?

Let me know if you'd like to adjust or add anything to this document.
Impossible Foods claims that their plant-based products offer several health benefits. These include lower levels of cholesterol and saturated fats compared to traditional beef products. They also emphasize that their products contain high-quality protein, essential vitamins, and minerals like iron and B12, which are typically found in animal products. The idea is that these products offer a healthier alternative to meat without sacrificing the nutritional value.

#### 6. Looking at the nutritional information for the “Impossible Burger”, do you see any nutritional concerns? If so, what are they?

While the Impossible Burger contains beneficial nutrients like protein and iron, some concerns may arise from the relatively high sodium content compared to traditional meat. Additionally, the burger contains processed ingredients, which might be a concern for individuals trying to avoid overly processed foods. Consumers might also want to consider the fat content, especially saturated fats, though it is typically lower than in beef burgers.

#### 7. What does the manufacturer claim are the environmental benefits of humans consuming “Impossible” foods?

Impossible Foods claims that their products have a much lower environmental impact compared to traditional beef production. They emphasize that producing plant-based burgers uses significantly less water, generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and requires less land. The company suggests that switching to plant-based proteins can help mitigate deforestation, water shortages, and climate change.

#### 8. Do you think that “Impossible” foods are the answer to our environmental concerns? Explain why or why not.

While Impossible Foods and similar products certainly help address some environmental concerns—such as reducing water usage and greenhouse gas emissions—these products alone may not be the complete solution. Transitioning to plant-based diets is a step in the right direction, but broader changes in agricultural practices and consumer habits are also necessary to fully tackle environmental issues. Additionally, the production and consumption of highly processed plant-based products raise questions about long-term sustainability and health. A balanced approach, including both whole foods and plant-based alternatives, might be a better solution.
