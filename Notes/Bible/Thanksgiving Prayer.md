**Heavenly Father,**

We gather today in gratitude and unity, giving thanks for the blessings You have bestowed upon us. Whether we find ourselves in seasons of joy or in moments of challenge, we recognize that Your presence is constant, and for that, we are deeply thankful.

Thank You for the gift of this day, where we can come together as family and friends. Whether we are all physically present in one room, connecting across distances, or holding loved ones in our hearts, we cherish the bonds that unite us.

Today, we remember and honor those who have been part of our lives — Uncle Jimmy, Uncle Nick, and all the parents, friends, family, and acquaintances who have shaped our journey, whether they are still with us or have passed on. Their love, lessons, and laughter remain in our hearts as a testament to Your grace.

As we prepare to enjoy the food, drinks, and fellowship before us, let us take a moment to reflect on Your Word. In the words of Paul from 1 Thessalonians:  
_"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."_

Help us to live these words, not just today, but every day. Let our hearts overflow with gratitude for Your endless mercy, and may we always see Your goodness in the world around us.

Bless this meal, bless this gathering, and bless each of us as we go forth from this moment. May we carry the spirit of thanksgiving with us and continue to be a light to others.

In Jesus’ name, we pray,  
**Amen.**
