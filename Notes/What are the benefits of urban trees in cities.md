# What are the benefits of urban trees in cities?

When people think of trees, they tend to think of vast forests far away from the commotion of a city. These [forests](https://environmentamerica.org/topics/forests/) are important for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and clean water, but trees in our cities and suburbs also serve an important purpose. Urban trees clean our air, lower temperatures and even save money.

Cities tend to have higher temperatures, more greenhouse gas emissions, worse air quality and more noise pollution than rural and wild areas. Planting trees in parks, along sidewalks, on corporate campuses or in private yards can help address these problems.

### Reducing air pollution

Trees absorb carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants from the air, reducing human exposure to them. Unfortunately, trees are also [harmed](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/nature-trees.htm#:~:text=Studies%20have%20found,tree%20growth%20decreased.) by some of these pollutants so the best way forward is to reduce emissions from cars, trucks and power plants. In the meantime, trees can help mitigate some of the health effects of air pollution.

### Cooling down the neighborhood

Urban areas that are lacking trees often have less shade and evaporation, which can lead to heat islands. Trees can create a more habitable and enjoyable local climate with more moisture, cooler temperatures and buffered wind. This will be increasingly important as extreme heat becomes more common due to climate change.

### Clean water

Trees can [reduce toxic runoff](https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands#:~:text=Enhanced%20stormwater%20management%20and%20water%20quality%3A%C2%A0Vegetation%20reduces%20runoff%20and%20improves%20water%20quality%20by%20absorbing%20and%20filtering%20rainwater.) and reduce flooding by catching rain in their leaves and stopping it from reaching the ground and by their roots soaking up rain and pushing it back into the atmosphere. Both of these functions limit the amount of water running over polluted urban surfaces and being pumped directly into streams. Trees also remove chemicals from polluted water.

### More wildlife in our cities

Urban trees and forests are especially important for birds whose population numbers have plummeted since 1970.

### Other benefits

Environmental benefits are not the only reasons why urban trees should be valued. Trees make communities more livable for residents by adding natural beauty, improving mental health and providing spaces for solitude and privacy.

Increasing urban trees in cities has the potential to make the lives of future generations more enjoyable and counter the effects of climate change.

### Fun facts about urban trees

-   More than 20% of the worldâ€™s bird species live in cities.  
    An acre of trees produces enough oxygen for 18 people every day.  
    One healthy tree can store 13 pounds of carbon annually.  
    Trees providing shade to buildings can reduce the need for air conditioning, saving energy.
