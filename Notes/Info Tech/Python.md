# Python Overview

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, flexibility, and extensive library support. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, scripting, and more.

## Key Features

- **Ease of Use**: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and closely resembles natural language.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for small scripts and enterprise-level applications.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Thousands of libraries and frameworks make Python ideal for various tasks.
- **Community Support**: A large, active community ensures regular updates and ample learning resources.

## Common Use Cases

- **Web Development**: Frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
- **Data Science**: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks with simplicity.
- **Game Development**: Libraries like Pygame.
## Python Notes
```dataview  
TABLE WITHOUT ID
link(file.path, title) AS "Note", type AS "Type", created_at AS "Date Created", file.mtime AS "Last Modified", status AS "Status"
FROM "Notes"
WHERE contains(topic, "Python") AND type != "Dashboard" AND type != "Project"
SORT title ASC

```

### Projects

```dataview  
TABLE WITHOUT ID
link(file.path, title) AS "Note", type AS "Type", created_at AS "Date Created", file.mtime AS "Last Modified", status AS "Status"
FROM "Notes"
WHERE contains(topic, "Python") AND type = "Project"
SORT title ASC
SORT created_at ASC
```
## Syntax Basics

### Variables and Data Types
```python
# Variable assignment
x = 10       # Integer
y = 3.14     # Float
name = "Python"  # String
is_fun = True    # Boolean
```

### Conditionals and Loops
```python
# Conditional statements
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```

### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Nicholas"))
```

### Classes
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound."

dog = Animal("Dog")
print(dog.speak())
```
