## **THE OLSSON RUBY**

Thank you for purchasing the Olsson Ruby Nozzle! The Olsson Ruby was made to be extra durable for printing abrasive materials but has proven to work excellently with any material. And while the ruby tip of the nozzle is extremely wear resistant, there are a couple of things you should keep in mind to make sure your nozzle stays in perfect condition.

Care

If you keep these simple precautions in mind, the Olsson Ruby will serve you well for a long long time. Whether you're printing with abrasive specialty filaments such as Colorfabb's XT-CF20, or just plain old PLA, we're confident you will be happy with this nozzle.

DO NOT EXPOSE TO IMPACTS

Be careful not to drop the nozzle on hard surfaces. The ruby tip is very hard but can chip if it gets hit sharply.

Also make sure that you do not let the nozzle hit the glass retaining clips.

Cleaning

If you keep these simple precautions in mind, the Olsson Ruby will serve you well for a long long time. Whether you're printing with abrasive specialty filaments such as Colorfabb's XT-CF20, or just plain old PLA, we're confident you will be happy with this nozzle.

If you need to clean the outside of the nozzle you can use a piece of cotton / linen cloth or a paper towel while the nozzle is hot. Be careful not to burn your fingers.

If that is not enough you can step up to steel wool to get stubborn burnt plastic off.

Do not use scotch brite pads to clean the nozzle as it will scratch the outer part of the nozzle. This is due to the rough side of these sponges being made out of aluminum oxide, the same material as Rubies. 

Do not use a wire brush when cleaning the nozzle. One of the strands may get lodged in the orifice and crack the ruby.

To clean the inside of the nozzle, always start by using the [Atomic Method / Cold Pull.](https://support.3dverkstan.se/article/10-the) This will almost always be enough, and is the least potentially harmful method for clearing a clog.

Never attempt a cold pull outside of the printer, the nozzle needs to have the back flange supported while you apply the large pulling force, doing this without the support of the heat break may cause the nozzle parts to separate.  

If several of these have not cleared the clog, you can upgrade to trying acupuncture needle. However, it is important that you do not bend the needle heavily while using it as this can destroy the ruby.

Do not use a flame to burn out residues from a nozzle as a way of cleaning them.
