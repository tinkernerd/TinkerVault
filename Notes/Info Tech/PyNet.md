## Net_Tools
Made a python script that intakes 2 ip addresses and the subnet. 

`binandify.py`
It returns the binary conversions for the ip addresses and the subnet mask and wether or not it belongs to the same network. 

`net-info.py`
this script takes in an ip address and returns the ip address, the subnet mask, the network address, the broadcast address, and the first and last usable ip addresses.s
