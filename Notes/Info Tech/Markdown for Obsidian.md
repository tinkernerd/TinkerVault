# Markdown for Obsidian


Obsidian uses Markdown for note-taking with additional features to enhance interconnectivity.

## Obsidian-Specific Syntax
### Internal Links
Link to another note using `[[Note Title]]`.

### Callouts
Create styled blocks with `> [!type]`:
```markdown
> [!info] Info
> This is an information block.
```

### Embeds
Embed notes or media:
```markdown
![[filename]]
```

### Dataview Plugin
Query and display data dynamically:
```markdown
```dataview
table file.name as "File Name"
from "Notes"
```
```
