3.  In the white space 'Right Click' and select "Add a network location" (This window should then appear).
4.  Click "Next", then "Next again.
5.  Enter the Network Drive's network path
> [!info] (ex. T Drive: "[172.16.45.150dept](file://172.16.45.150/dept)")
6.  Click "Next", then name the network location the Drive Letter Name (So end user is more familiar that it is the network drive, ex. "T Drive")
7.  Click "Finish"
