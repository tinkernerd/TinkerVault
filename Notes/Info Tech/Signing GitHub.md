```bash
git config --global user.signingkey you@email.domain
```

# Now you can make a release as normal, but with a signed commit.
`git tag -s v0.1 -m "the best version yet"`

The only difference here is the -s. 

Before you upload the tag be sure to check your signature with 

`git tag --verify v0.1.`

# Push it
git push --tags origin
