# HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP response status codes provide insight into whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Each status code falls into one of five major categories:

1. **Informational Responses (100–199)**: The request was received and understood, and the client may proceed with sending the rest of the request or ignore it if already complete.
2. **Successful Responses (200–299)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
3. **Redirection Messages (300–399)**: The client must take additional action to complete the request.
4. **Client Error Responses (400–499)**: There was an error in the request, typically due to issues on the client side.
5. **Server Error Responses (500–599)**: The server encountered an error or is incapable of performing the request.

These codes are standardized by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**, primarily documented in **RFC 9110**. It’s essential to note that some status codes may be non-standard, especially when custom responses are generated by specific server software.

## 1. Informational Responses (100–199)

Informational status codes indicate a provisional response. These codes are intended for the client to receive additional information or take further action.

- **100 Continue**: The server received the initial part of the request, and the client should continue with the rest.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is switching to the protocol specified in the `Upgrade` header.
- **102 Processing (Deprecated)**: Used in WebDAV, this code indicated that the request was received but not completed.
- **103 Early Hints**: Used with the `Link` header to allow the client to preload resources while the server finalizes the response.

## 2. Successful Responses (200–299)

Successful status codes indicate that the client's request was successfully processed by the server.

- **200 OK**: The request was successful; content varies based on HTTP method:
  - **GET**: Resource fetched and transmitted.
  - **HEAD**: Headers included without body.
  - **PUT/POST**: Result of the action in the body.
  - **TRACE**: Body contains the received request.

- **201 Created**: A new resource was created, commonly after POST or PUT requests.
- **202 Accepted**: The request was accepted but not yet acted upon, often for asynchronous processing.
- **203 Non-Authoritative Information**: Metadata may differ from the origin server.
- **204 No Content**: No content to send for this request; headers are still useful.
- **205 Reset Content**: Client should reset the document from which the request was made.
- **206 Partial Content**: Used for range requests, where only part of a resource is returned.
- **207 Multi-Status (WebDAV)**: Information about multiple resources in situations where multiple status codes might be applicable.
- **208 Already Reported (WebDAV)**: Prevents redundant enumeration of resources.
- **226 IM Used**: Indicates that instance-manipulations were applied to the resource.

## 3. Redirection Messages (300–399)

Redirection status codes indicate that further action is required by the client to complete the request.

- **300 Multiple Choices**: Multiple possible responses; user or client should choose.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Resource URL has permanently changed.
- **302 Found**: URI of the resource is temporarily different; changes may occur later.
- **303 See Other**: Directs the client to retrieve the resource using a GET request at another URI.
- **304 Not Modified**: Tells the client to use the cached version of the response.
- **305 Use Proxy (Deprecated)**: Required accessing via a proxy; deprecated for security.
- **306 Unused**: Reserved but not used.
- **307 Temporary Redirect**: Redirects client to another URI without changing the method.
- **308 Permanent Redirect**: Permanent redirect without changing the HTTP method.

## 4. Client Error Responses (400–499)

Client error status codes indicate issues with the client's request. These errors are often resolvable by the client.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required to access the resource.
- **402 Payment Required**: Reserved for future digital payment systems.
- **403 Forbidden**: Client does not have permissions to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource could not be found; often the most recognized status.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: HTTP method not supported by the target resource.
- **406 Not Acceptable**: Content does not conform to client-specified criteria.
- **407 Proxy Authentication Required**: Authentication required through a proxy.
- **408 Request Timeout**: Idle connection; server shuts down connection.
- **409 Conflict**: Request conflicts with server state.
- **410 Gone**: Resource has been permanently deleted with no forwarding address.
- **411 Length Required**: `Content-Length` header is required but not provided.
- **412 Precondition Failed**: Server does not meet conditions in request headers.
- **413 Content Too Large**: Request body exceeds server-defined limits.
- **414 URI Too Long**: URI exceeds server interpretation limits.
- **415 Unsupported Media Type**: Media format is not supported.
- **416 Range Not Satisfiable**: Requested range cannot be fulfilled.
- **417 Expectation Failed**: Expectation in `Expect` header cannot be met.
- **418 I'm a teapot**: Joke response indicating the server is unwilling to brew coffee.
- **421 Misdirected Request**: Request sent to an inappropriate server.
- **422 Unprocessable Content (WebDAV)**: Request cannot be processed due to semantic errors.
- **423 Locked (WebDAV)**: Resource is locked.
- **424 Failed Dependency (WebDAV)**: Request failed due to another request’s failure.
- **425 Too Early**: Experimental; request may be replayed, server unwilling to process.
- **426 Upgrade Required**: Server needs the client to upgrade the protocol.
- **428 Precondition Required**: Conditional request required to prevent lost updates.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate-limiting response due to too many requests in a timeframe.
- **431 Request Header Fields Too Large**: Headers too large for the server to process.
- **451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons**: Resource unavailable due to legal restrictions.

## 5. Server Error Responses (500–599)

Server error codes indicate that the server has encountered an error and cannot complete the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic error when the server cannot specify a more precise error.
- **501 Not Implemented**: Request method is unsupported.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: Server received an invalid response while acting as a gateway.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server is not ready, commonly due to maintenance or overload.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: Server acting as a gateway did not receive a timely response.
- **505 HTTP Version Not Supported**: HTTP version is unsupported.
- **506 Variant Also Negotiates**: Internal configuration error; variant negotiates itself.
- **507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV)**: Server cannot store necessary representations.
- **508 Loop Detected (WebDAV)**: Server detected an infinite loop in the request processing.
- **510 Not Extended**: Client request requires an unsupported HTTP extension.
- **511 Network Authentication Required**: Client must authenticate for network access.
