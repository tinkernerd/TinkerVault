# Working with Git Branches
Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

## **1. Create a New Branch**
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

## **2. Switch to a Branch**
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

## **3. Combine Changes with Merging**
Merge a branch into the current branch:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```
