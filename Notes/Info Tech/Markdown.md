Think of it like a campaign in Dungeons & Dragons: every bit of knowledge you document is like gaining experience points (XP). The more you document, the more you learn, and the closer you get to leveling up your skills and abilities. At Level 1, you might just be jotting down simple notes, but as you advance, your documentation can become a legendary artifact in its own right, guiding others through the labyrinth of complex topics.
# Markdown
Markdown is the sword of the documentation world: simple to wield but incredibly powerful. Master it to slay the dragons of disorganization:
## Markdown Notes
```dataview  
TABLE WITHOUT ID
link(file.path, title) AS "Note", type AS "Type", created_at AS "Date Created", file.mtime AS "Last Modified", status AS "Status"
WHERE type != "Dashboard" AND contains(topic, "Markdown")
SORT title ASC
