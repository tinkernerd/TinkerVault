# JavaScript Functions

Functions are one of the core building blocks in JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate code that can be reused.

## Topics Covered

- **Function Declaration**: 
  ```javascript
  function myFunction() {
    // code to be executed
  }
  ```
- **Function Expression**:
  ```javascript
  const myFunction = function() {
    // code to be executed
  }
  ```
- **Arrow Functions**:
  ```javascript
  const myFunction = () => {
    // code to be executed
  }
  ```

Functions can take parameters and return values, and understanding their scope is crucial to writing effective JavaScript code.
