## Notes
### To do list:
1.	There is already some level of coding within this program. You’ve been given a while loop along with a statement that imports a module. You’ll need to modify the appropriate functions to allow this program to read, write, or append to the data.csv file. 
2.	Make sure to provide a flowchart and pseudocode for this program. Along with the program file Module8_lastname.py.
3.	The end result should look similar to the following… 
### Option B: 
Option B Tkinter-based program: 
1.	There is already some level of coding within this program. This program already has the appropriate fields necessary to create the objects for your GUI environment. Your goal is to modify the functions to allow the user to append, read, or write data to the data.csv file.  
2.	If you decide to perform option B, you do not have to perform a flowchart pseudocode. You will only be responsible for uploading a completed .py file. Make sure to label it Module8_lastname.py
