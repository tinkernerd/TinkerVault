# ChatGPT Prompting Cheat Sheet

## How Prompt Engineering Works

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for language models like ChatGPT. Itâ€™s crucial for natural language processing (NLP) and language generation tasks, such as product descriptions or conversational AI.

- Prompts guide the model in performing specific tasks.
- Reliable prompt formats exist, but experimenting with new formats is encouraged.

## Rules of Thumb for Prompt Engineering

### Rule #1: Instructions and Separators

Start with clear instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use `###` or `"""` to separate instructions or context.

Example:

```text
Rewrite the text below in more engaging language.

Text: """
{your input here}
"""
```

---

### Rule #2: Be Specific and Detailed

Be explicit about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style.

Example:

```text
Write a funny soccer story for kids that teaches the importance of persistence, in the style of J.K. Rowling.
```

---

### Rule #3: Provide Example Outputs

If possible, provide examples of the desired output format.

Example:

```text
Extract house pricing data from the following text.

Desired format: """
House 1 | $1,000,000 | 100 sqm
House 2 | $500,000 | 90 sqm
"""
```

---

### Rule #4: Try Without Examples First

When starting, avoid providing examples. If results are suboptimal, provide examples for better clarity.

Example:

```text
Extract brand names from the text below.

Text: Finxter and YouTube are tech companies.
Brand names:
```

---

### Rule #5: Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning the model improves performance. This technique trains the model on specific examples to produce higher-quality results, save tokens, and reduce latency.

Example training data:

```json
{"prompt": "<input>", "completion": "<ideal output>"}
{"prompt": "<input>", "completion": "<ideal output>"}
...
```

---

### Rule #6: Omit Needless Words

Be concise and to the point to avoid unnecessary complexity.

Example:

```text
Write a 5-sentence sales page selling sand in the desert.
```

---

### Rule #7: Use Leading Words

Use specific words or phrases to guide the model toward a desired pattern.

Example:

```python
# Python function that plots net worth over 10 years
# for different inputs on the initial investment and a given ROI

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_net_worth(initial, roi):
    # Function implementation
```

---

### Bonus Prompt: Let ChatGPT Design the Prompt

Allow ChatGPT to design an optimal prompt based on the task. For example, ask it:

```text
ChatGPT, what would be the most effective prompt for generating a marketing copy about solar panels?
```
