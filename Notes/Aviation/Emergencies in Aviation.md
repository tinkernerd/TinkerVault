# Emergencies in Aviation
Emergencies in aviation are rare but require quick thinking and adherence to procedures. This guide covers common emergencies, best practices, and resources to help pilots manage unexpected situations.
## 🛑 Key Emergency Concepts for Pilots:

# Types of Emergencies
- **Engine Failure**
	- Practice forced landings and know your best glide speed.
	- Example: "Engine failure during takeoff" procedures.
- **Electrical Failures**
	- Partial or complete loss of electrical systems.
	- Use standby instruments and hand-held radios if equipped.
- **Fuel Emergencies**
	- Monitor fuel consumption and plan diversions early.
	- Declare "minimum fuel" or "fuel emergency" as needed.
- **Loss of Communications (NORDO)**
	- Troubleshoot headset and radio issues.
	- Follow the light gun signals at towered airports.
- **Fire Onboard**
	- Execute fire procedures for engine or cabin fires.
	- Use fire extinguishers and vent smoke if possible.

# Emergency Communications
- **Mayday Calls**
	- Used for life-threatening emergencies.
	- Example: "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, N12345, engine failure, 10 miles east of XYZ airport, altitude 3,000 feet."
- **Pan-Pan Calls**
	- For non-life-threatening but urgent situations.
	- Example: "Pan-Pan, Pan-Pan, Pan-Pan, N12345, lost navigation equipment."
- **Transponder Codes**
	- 7700: General emergency.
	- 7600: Communication failure.
	- 7500: Hijacking.

# Emergency Landing
- **Forced Landing**
	- Select a suitable landing site (e.g., fields, roads).
	- Secure the aircraft and notify ATC if possible.
- **Ditching**
	- Prepare for water landings with life vests and flotation devices.
	- Brief passengers on evacuation procedures.

# Checklist Usage
- **Memory Items**
	- Immediate actions from memory (e.g., "Fuel selector: OFF" in an engine fire).
- **Emergency Checklists**
	- Reference the aircraft POH or QRH for detailed steps.

# Survival After Landing
- **Post-Landing Safety**
	- Evacuate passengers quickly and safely.
	- Activate ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter).
- **Emergency Kits**
	- Include food, water, first aid, and signaling devices.
