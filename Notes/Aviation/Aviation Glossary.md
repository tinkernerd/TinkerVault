# Pilot/Controller Glossary
## Purpose 

1. This Glossary was compiled to promote a common understanding of the terms used in the Air Traffic Control system. It includes those terms which are intended for pilot/controller communications. Those terms most frequently used in pilot/controller communications are on [[Common Aviation Terms]]. The definitions are primarily defined in an operational sense applicable to both users and operators of the National Airspace System. Use of the Glossary will preclude any misunderstandings concerning the system's design, function, and purpose. 
2. Because of the international nature of flying, terms used in the Lexicon, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are included when they differ from FAA definitions. These terms are followed by “(ICAO)” For the reader's convenience, there are also cross references to related terms in other parts of the Glossary and to other documents, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the (Refer to [[Aeronautical Information Manual|AIM]])
## Letter A
### AAI
See [[#Arrival Aircraft Interval]]
### AAR
See [[#Airport Arrival Rate (AAR)]]
### Abbreviated IFR Flight Plans
An authorization by ATC requiring pilots to submit only that information needed for the purpose of ATC. It includes only a small portion of the usual IFR flight plan information. In certain instances, this may be only aircraft identification, location, and pilot request. Other information may be requested if needed by ATC for separation/control purposes. It is frequently used by aircraft which are airborne and desire an instrument approach or by aircraft which are on the ground and desire a climb to VFR-on-top.

3. ODALS- Omnidirectional Approach Lighting System consists of seven omnidirectional flashing lights located in the approach area of a nonprecision runway. Five lights are located on the runway centerline extended with the first light located 300 feet from the threshold and extending at equal intervals up to 1,500 feet from the threshold. The other two lights are located, one on each side of the runway threshold, at a lateral distance of 40 feet from the runway edge, or 75 feet from the runway edge when installed on a runway equipped with a VASI. (Refer to FAA Order JO 6850.2, VISUAL GUIDANCE LIGHTING SYSTEMS.) 
	1. Runway Lights/Runway Edge Lights- Lights having a prescribed angle of emission used to define the lateral limits of a runway. Runway lights are uniformly spaced at intervals of approximately 200 feet, and the intensity may be controlled or preset. 
	2. Touchdown Zone Lighting- Two rows of transverse light bars located symmetrically about the runway centerline normally at 100 foot intervals. The basic system extends 3,000 feet along the runway.
	3. Runway Centerline Lighting- Flush centerline lights spaced at 50-foot intervals beginning 75 feet from the landing threshold and extending to within 75 feet of the opposite end of the runway. 
	4. Threshold Lights- Fixed green lights arranged symmetrically left and right of the runway centerline, identifying the runway threshold.
	5. Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL)- Two synchronized flashing lights, one on each side of the runway threshold, which provide rapid and positive identification of the approach end of a particular runway.
	6. Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI)- An airport lighting facility providing vertical visual approach slope guidance to aircraft during approach to landing by radiating a directional pattern of high intensity red and white focused light beams which indicate to the pilot that he/she is “on path” if he/she sees red/white, “above path” if white/white, and “below path” if red/red. Some airports serving large aircraft have three-bar VASIs which provide two visual glide paths to the same runway. 
	7. Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI)- An airport lighting facility, similar to VASI, providing vertical approach slope guidance to aircraft during approach to landing. PAPIs consist of a single row of either two or four lights, normally installed on the left side of the runway, and have an effective visual range of about 5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles at night. PAPIs radiate a directional pattern of high intensity red and white focused light beams which indicate that the pilot is “on path” if the pilot sees an equal number of white lights and red lights, with white to the left of the red; “above path” if the pilot sees more white than red lights; and “below path” if the pilot sees more red than white lights.
	8. Boundary Lights- Lights defining the perimeter of an airport or landing area. (Refer to [[Aeronautical Information Manual|AIM]])

The standard design is to align the procedure on the extended centerline with the missed approach point (MAP) at the runway threshold, the final approach fix (FAF), and the initial approach/intermediate fix (IAF/IF). The other two IAFs will be established perpendicular to the IF.  
- **Modified T** - An RNAV approach design for single or multiple runways where terrain or operational constraints do not allow for the standard T. The "T" may be modified by increasing or decreasing the angle from the corner IAF(s) to the IF or by eliminating one or both corner IAFs.  
- **Standard I** - An RNAV approach design for a single runway with both corner IAFs eliminated. Course reversal or radar vectoring may be required at busy terminals with multiple runways.  
- **Terminal Arrival Area (TAA)** - The TAA is controlled airspace established in conjunction with the Standard or Modified T and I RNAV approach configurations. In the standard TAA, there are three areas: straight-in, left base, and right base. The arc boundaries of the three areas of the TAA are published portions of the approach and allow aircraft to transition from the en route structure direct to the nearest IAF. TAAs will also eliminate or reduce feeder routes, departure extensions, and procedure turns or course reversal.  

  1. **Straight-In Area** - A 30 NM arc centered on the IF bounded by a straight line extending through the IF perpendicular to the intermediate course.  
  2. **Left Base Area** - A 30 NM arc centered on the right corner IAF. The area shares a boundary with the straight-in area except that it extends out for 30 NM from the IAF and is bounded on the other side by a line extending from the IF through the FAF to the arc.  
  3. **Right Base Area** - A 30 NM arc centered on the left corner IAF. The area shares a boundary with the straight-in area except that it extends out for 30 NM from the IAF and is bounded on the other side by a line extending from the IF through the FAF to the arc.

### Braking Action Advisories
When tower controllers receive runway braking action reports which include the terms “medium," “poor," or “nil," or whenever weather conditions are conducive to deteriorating or rapidly changing runway braking conditions, the tower will include on the ATIS broadcast the statement, “Braking Action Advisories are in Effect."  

During the time braking action advisories are in effect, ATC will issue the most current braking action report for the runway in use to each arriving and departing aircraft. Pilots should be prepared for deteriorating braking conditions and should request current runway condition information if not issued by controllers. Pilots should also be prepared to provide a descriptive runway condition report to controllers after landing.

Used in an ATC clearance to authorize a pilot to conduct flight at any altitude from the minimum IFR altitude up to and including the altitude specified in the clearance.  

- The pilot may level off at any intermediate altitude within this block of airspace. Climb/descent within the block is to be made at the discretion of the pilot.  
- However, once the pilot starts descent and verbally reports leaving an altitude in the block, they may not return to that altitude without additional ATC clearance.  
- Further, it is approval for the pilot to proceed to and make an approach at the destination airport and can be used in conjunction with:  
  1. An airport clearance limit at locations with a standard/special instrument approach procedure.  
	  - The CFRs require that if an instrument letdown to an airport is necessary, the pilot shall make the letdown in accordance with a standard/special instrument approach procedure for that airport.  
  2. An airport clearance limit at locations that are within/below/outside controlled airspace and without a standard/special instrument approach procedure.  
	  - Such a clearance is **not authorization** for the pilot to descend under IFR conditions below the applicable minimum IFR altitude, nor does it imply that ATC is exercising control over aircraft in Class G airspace.  
	  - However, it provides a means for the aircraft to proceed to the destination airport, descend, and land in accordance with applicable CFRs governing VFR flight operations.  
	  - This also provides search and rescue protection until such time as the IFR flight plan is closed.

The **GBAS station** transmits:  
- **Locally corrected GNSS data**  
- **Integrity parameters**  
- **Approach information**  

This improves the **accuracy of aircraft GNSS receivers' signals**, enabling the pilot to fly a **precision approach** with **greater flexibility and reliability**.  

- **GLS procedures** are published on **standard IAP charts**.
- **Title format:** **GLS with the designated runway**.
- **Minima:** As low as **200 feet DA**.  
- **Future plans** expect to support **CAT II and CAT III operations**.

### Ground Clutter
A **pattern produced on the radar scope** by **ground returns**, which may **degrade other radar returns** in the affected area.  

The effect of **ground clutter** is **minimized** by using:  
- **Moving target indicator (MTI) circuits** in the radar equipment.  
- Resulting in a **radar presentation** that displays **only targets in motion**.  
See [[#Clutter]]
### Ground Communication Outlet (GCO)
An **unstaffed, remotely controlled, ground/ground communications facility**.  

Pilots at **uncontrolled airports** may contact ATC and FSS via **VHF radio to a telephone connection**.  

- If the connection goes to **ATC**, the pilot can:
  - **Obtain an IFR clearance**.
  - **Close an IFR flight plan**.  

- If the connection goes to **Flight Service**, the pilot can:
  - **Open or close a VFR flight plan**.
  - **Obtain an updated weather briefing prior to takeoff**.
  - **Close an IFR flight plan**.
  - For **Alaska or MEDEVAC only**, obtain an **IFR clearance**.  

**Usage:**  
- **Pilots use four "key clicks"** on the VHF radio to contact the **appropriate ATC facility**.  
- **Pilots use six "key clicks"** to contact the **FSS**.  
- **GCO system** is intended **for ground use only**.

### Ground Controlled Approach (GCA)
A **radar approach system** operated from the **ground** by **air traffic control personnel**, who transmit **instructions to the pilot via radio**.  

The approach may be conducted:  
- **With surveillance radar (ASR) only**.  
- **With both surveillance and precision approach radar (PAR)**.  

**Usage:**  
- The term **"GCA"** should be used only when referring to a **GCA facility**.  
- **Pilots should specifically request a "PAR" approach** when a **precision radar approach is desired**.  
- **Pilots should request an "ASR" or "surveillance" approach** when a **non-precision radar approach is desired**.  

(See **Radar Approach**.)
### Ground Delay Program (GDP)
A **traffic management process** administered by the **ATCSCC**, where aircraft are **held on the ground**.  

**Purpose:**  
- Supports the **Traffic Management (TM) mission**.

- Provides **equitable assignment of delays** to all system users.  
- **Flexible program** that may be implemented in **various forms** based on **AT system needs**.  
### Ground Speed
The **speed of an aircraft** relative to the **surface of the Earth**.
### Ground Stop (GS)
A process that **requires aircraft meeting specific criteria to remain on the ground**.  

**Criteria may be:**  
- **Airport-specific** (e.g., all departures to **San Francisco**).  
- **Airspace-specific** (e.g., all departures entering **Yorktown sector**).
- **Equipment-specific** (e.g., all **Category I and II aircraft** going to **Charlotte**).

**Characteristics of a Ground Stop:**  
- **Typically occurs with little or no warning**.
