GATE HOLD PROCEDURES- Procedures at selected airports to hold aircraft at the gate or other ground location whenever departure delays exceed or are anticipated to exceed 15 minutes. The sequence for departure will be maintained in accordance with initial call-up unless modified by flow control restrictions. Pilots should monitor the ground control/clearance delivery frequency for engine start/taxi advisories or new proposed start/taxi time if the delay changes.

[(See GLIDESLOPE INTERCEPT ALTITUDE.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GLIDESLOPE%20INTERCEPT%20ALTITUDE)

GLIDESLOPE- Provides vertical guidance for aircraft during approach and landing. The glideslope/glidepath is based on the following:

1.  Electronic components emitting signals which provide vertical guidance by reference to airborne instruments during instrument approaches such as ILS; or,
2.  Visual ground aids, such as VASI, which provide vertical guidance for a VFR approach or for the visual portion of an instrument approach and landing.
3.  PAR. Used by ATC to inform an aircraft making a PAR approach of its vertical position (elevation) relative to the descent profile.

[(See ICAO term GLIDEPATH.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GLIDEPATH%20[ICAO])

GLIDESLOPE INTERCEPT ALTITUDE- The published minimum altitude to intercept the glideslope in the intermediate segment of an instrument approach. Government charts use the lightning bolt symbol to identify this intercept point. This intersection is called the Precise Final Approach fix (PFAF). ATC directs a higher altitude, the resultant intercept becomes the PFAF.

**_GO AHEAD-_** Proceed with your message. Not to be used for any other purpose.

**_GO AROUND-_** Instructions for a pilot to abandon his/her approach to landing. Additional instructions may follow. Unless otherwise advised by ATC, a VFR aircraft or an aircraft conducting visual approach should overfly the runway while climbing to traffic pattern altitude and enter the traffic pattern via the crosswind leg. A pilot on an IFR flight plan making an instrument approach should execute the published missed approach procedure or proceed as instructed by ATC; e.g., “Go around” (additional instructions if required).

GRAPHICAL AIRMEN'S METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION- A graphical depiction of weather that may be hazardous to aircraft, but are less severe than SIGMETs. G-AIRMETS are issued 3 hours apart for a period of up to 12 hours into the future for the lower 48 states and coastal waters. The weather hazards depicted can be:

1.  Moderate turbulence
2.  Low-level windshear
3.  Strong surface winds greater than 30 knots

GROSS NAVIGATION ERROR (GNE) - A lateral deviation of 10 NM or more from the aircraft's cleared route.

GROUND BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (GBAS)- A ground based GNSS station which provides local differential corrections, integrity parameters and approach data via VHF data broadcast to GNSS users to meet real-time performance requirements for CAT I precision approaches. The aircraft applies the broadcast data to improve the accuracy and integrity of its GNSS signals and computes the deviations to the selected approach.  A single ground station can serve multiple runway ends up to an approximate radius of 23 NM. 

GROUND BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (GBAS) LANDING SYSTEM (GLS)- A type of precision IAP based on local augmentation of GNSS data using a single GBAS station to transmit locally corrected GNSS data, integrity parameters and approach information. This improves the accuracy of aircraft GNSS receivers' signal in space, enabling the pilot to fly a precision approach with much greater flexibility, reliability and complexity. The GLS procedure is published on standard IAP charts, features the title GLS with the designated runway and minima as low as 200 feet DA. Future plans are expected to support Cat II and CAT III operations.

GROUND-BASED INTERVAL MANAGEMENT-SPACING (GIM-S), SPEED ADVISORY- A calculated speed that will allow aircraft to meet the TBFM schedule at en route and TRACON boundary meter fixes.

GROUND CLUTTER- A pattern produced on the radar scope by ground returns which may degrade other radar returns in the affected area. The effect of ground clutter is minimized by the use of moving target indicator (MTI) circuits in the radar equipment resulting in a radar presentation which displays only targets which are in motion.

[(See CLUTTER.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-c.html#$CLUTTER)

GROUND COMMUNICATION OUTLET (GCO)- An unstaffed, remotely controlled, ground/ground communications facility. Pilots at uncontrolled airports may contact ATC and FSS via VHF radio to a telephone connection. If the connection goes to ATC, the pilot can obtain an IFR clearance or close an IFR flight plan. If the connection goes to Flight Service, the pilot can open or close a VFR flight plan; obtain an updated weather briefing prior to takeoff; close an IFR flight plan; or, for Alaska or MEDEVAC only, obtain an IFR clearance. Pilots will use four “key clicks” on the VHF radio to contact the appropriate ATC facility or six “key clicks” to contact the FSS. The GCO system is intended to be used only on the ground.

GROUND CONTROLLED APPROACH- A radar approach system operated from the ground by air traffic control personnel transmitting instructions to the pilot by radio. The approach may be conducted with surveillance radar (ASR) only or with both surveillance and precision approach radar (PAR). Usage of the term “GCA” by pilots is discouraged except when referring to a GCA facility. Pilots should specifically request a “PAR” approach when a precision radar approach is desired or request an “ASR” or “surveillance” approach when a nonprecision radar approach is desired.

[(See RADAR APPROACH.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RADAR%20APPROACH)

GROUND DELAY PROGRAM (GDP)- A traffic management process administered by the ATCSCC, when aircraft are held on the ground. The purpose of the program is to support the TM mission and limit airborne holding. It is a flexible program and may be implemented in various forms depending upon the needs of the AT system. Ground delay programs provide for equitable assignment of delays to all system users.

GROUND SPEED- The speed of an aircraft relative to the surface of the earth.

GROUND STOP (GS)- The GS is a process that requires aircraft that meet a specific criteria to remain on the ground. The criteria may be airport specific, airspace specific, or equipment specific; for example, all departures to San Francisco, or all departures entering Yorktown sector, or all Category I and II aircraft going to Charlotte. GSs normally occur with little or no warning.
