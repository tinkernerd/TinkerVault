SAFETY ALERT- A safety alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their control if ATC is aware the aircraft is at an altitude which, in the controller's judgment, places the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. The controller may discontinue the issuance of further alerts if the pilot advises he/she is taking action to correct the situation or has the other aircraft in sight.

1.  Terrain/Obstruction Alert- A safety alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their control if ATC is aware the aircraft is at an altitude which, in the controller's judgment, places the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain/obstructions; e.g., “Low Altitude Alert, check your altitude immediately.”
2.  Aircraft Conflict Alert- A safety alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their control if ATC is aware of an aircraft that is not under their control at an altitude which, in the controller's judgment, places both aircraft in unsafe proximity to each other. With the alert, ATC will offer the pilot an alternate course of action when feasible; e.g., “Traffic Alert, advise you turn right heading zero niner zero or climb to eight thousand immediately.”

Note: The issuance of a safety alert is contingent upon the capability of the controller to have an awareness of an unsafe condition. The course of action provided will be predicated on other traffic under ATC control. Once the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot's prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, he/she will take.

SAFETY LOGIC SYSTEM- A software enhancement to ASDE-3, ASDE-X, and ASSC, that predicts the path of aircraft landing and/or departing, and/or vehicular movements on runways. Visual and aural alarms are activated when the safety logic projects a potential collision. The Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) is a safety logic system enhancement to the ASDE-3. The Safety Logic System for ASDE-X and ASSC is an integral part of the software program.

SAFETY LOGIC SYSTEM ALERTS-

1.  ALERT-
    1.  An actual situation involving two real Safety Logic tracks (aircraft/aircraft, aircraft/vehicle, or aircraft/other tangible object) that the Safety Logic System has predicted will result in an imminent collision, based upon the Safety Logic parameters.
    2.  An actual situation involving a single Safety Logic track arriving to, or departing from, a closed runway.
    3.  An actual situation involving a single Safety Logic track arriving to a taxiway.
2.  FALSE ALERT-
    1.  Alerts generated by one or more false surface radar or cooperative surveillance targets, that the ASDE system has interpreted as real tracks and placed into Safety Logic.
    2.  Alerts in which the Safety Logic System did not perform correctly, based upon the design specifications and Safety Logic parameters.
    3.  Alerts generated by surface radar targets caused by moderate or greater precipitation.
3.  NUISANCE ALERT- An alert in which one or more of the following is true:
    1.  The alert is generated by a known situation that is not considered an unsafe operation, such as LAHSO or other approved operations.
    2.  The alert is generated by inaccurate cooperative surveillance data received by the Safety Logic System.
    3.  One or more of the aircraft involved in the alert is not intending to use a runway/taxiway (helicopter, pipeline patrol, non-Mode C overflight, etc.).
4.  VALID NON-ALERT- A situation in which the Safety Logic System correctly determines that an alert is not required, based upon the design specifications and Safety Logic parameters.
5.  I NVALID NON-ALERT- A situation in which the Safety Logic System did not issue an alert when an alert was required, based upon the design specifications and Safety Logic parameters.

SAIL BACK- A maneuver during high wind conditions (usually with power off) where float plane movement is controlled by water rudders/opening and closing cabin doors.

Services delivered directly by a flight service specialist via ground/ground communication, air/ground communication, in-person, or technology (for example, speech-to-text, email, or short message service).

SPEED-

[(See AIRSPEED.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-a.html#$AIRSPEED)

[(See GROUND SPEED.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GROUND%20SPEED)

SPEED ADJUSTMENT- An ATC procedure used to request pilots to adjust aircraft speed to a specific value for the purpose of providing desired spacing. Pilots are expected to maintain a speed of plus or minus 10 knots or 0.02 Mach number of the specified speed. Examples of speed adjustments are:

1.  “Increase/reduce speed to Mach point (number).”
2.  “Increase/reduce speed to (speed in knots)” or “Increase/reduce speed (number of knots) knots.”

SPEED ADVISORY- Speed advisories that are generated within Time-Based Flow Management to assist controllers to meet the Scheduled Time of Arrival (STA) at the meter fix/meter arc. See also Ground-Based Interval Management-Spacing (GIM-S) Speed Advisory.

SPEED BRAKES- Moveable aerodynamic devices on aircraft that reduce airspeed during descent and landing.

SPEED SEGMENTS- Portions of the arrival route between the transition point and the vertex along the optimum flight path for which speeds and altitudes are specified. There is one set of arrival speed segments adapted from each transition point to each vertex. Each set may contain up to six segments.

SPOOFING- Denotes emissions of GNSS-like signals that may be acquired and tracked in combination with or instead of the intended signals by civil receivers. The onset of spoofing effects can be instantaneous or delayed, and effects can persist after the spoofing has ended.  Spoofing can result in false and potentially confusing, or hazardously misleading, position, navigation, and/or date/time information in addition to loss of GNSS use.

**_SQUAWK (Mode, Code, Function)-_** Used by ATC to instruct a pilot to activate the aircraft transponder and ADS-B Out with altitude reporting enabled, or (military) to activate only specific modes, codes, or functions. Examples: “Squawk five seven zero seven;” “Squawk three/alpha, two one zero five.”

**_STAND BY-_** Means the controller or pilot must pause for a few seconds, usually to attend to other duties of a higher priority. Also means to wait as in “stand by for clearance.” The caller should reestablish contact if a delay is lengthy. “Stand by” is not an approval or denial.

STANDARD INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE (SIAP)-

[(See INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-i.html#$INSTRUMENT%20APPROACH%20PROCEDURE)

STANDARD INSTRUMENT DEPARTURE (SID)- A preplanned instrument flight rule (IFR) air traffic control (ATC) departure procedure printed for pilot/controller use in graphic form to provide obstacle clearance and a transition from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure. SIDs are primarily designed for system enhancement to expedite traffic flow and to reduce pilot/controller workload. ATC clearance must always be received prior to flying a SID.

SUBSTITUTE ROUTE- A route assigned to pilots when any part of an airway or route is unusable because of NAVAID status. These routes consist of:

1.  Substitute routes which are shown on U.S. Government charts.
2.  Routes defined by ATC as specific NAVAID radials or courses.
3.  Routes defined by ATC as direct to or between NAVAIDs.

SUNSET AND SUNRISE- The mean solar times of sunset and sunrise as published in the Nautical Almanac, converted to local standard time for the locality concerned. Within Alaska, the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as defined for each locality.

SUPPLEMENTAL WEATHER SERVICE LOCATION- Airport facilities staffed with contract personnel who take weather observations and provide current local weather to pilots via telephone or radio. (All other services are provided by the parent FSS.)

SUPPS- Refers to ICAO Document 7030 Regional Supplementary Procedures. SUPPS contain procedures for each ICAO Region which are unique to that Region and are not covered in the worldwide provisions identified in the ICAO Air Navigation Plan. Procedures contained in Chapter 8 are based in part on those published in SUPPS.

SURFACE AREA- The airspace contained by the lateral boundary of the Class B, C, D, or E airspace designated for an airport that begins at the surface and extends upward.

SURFACE METERING PROGRAM- A capability within Terminal Flight Data Manager that provides the user with the ability to tactically manage surface traffic flows through adjusting desired minimum and maximum departure queue lengths to balance surface demand with capacity. When a demand/capacity imbalance for a surface resource is predicted, a metering procedure is recommended.

SURFACE VIEWER- A capability within the Traffic Flow Management System that provides situational awareness for a user-selected airport. The Surface Viewer displays a top-down view of an airport depicting runways, taxiways, gate areas, ramps, and buildings. The display also includes icons representing aircraft and vehicles currently on the surface, with identifying information. In addition, the display includes current airport configuration information such as departure/arrival runways and airport departure/arrival rates.

SURPIC- A description of surface vessels in the area of a Search and Rescue incident including their predicted positions and their characteristics.

(Refer to FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-6-4, INFLIGHT CONTINGENCIES.)

SURVEILLANCE APPROACH- An instrument approach wherein the air traffic controller issues instructions, for pilot compliance, based on aircraft position in relation to the final approach course (azimuth), and the distance (range) from the end of the runway as displayed on the controller's radar scope. The controller will provide recommended altitudes on final approach if requested by the pilot.

(Refer to AIM.)

SURVEILLANCE ENHANCED SEARCH AND RESCUE (SE SAR)- An automated service used to enhance search and rescue operations that provides federal contract flight service specialists direct information from the aircraft's registered tracking device.

SUSPICIOUS UAS- Suspicious UAS operations may include operating without authorization, loitering in the vicinity of sensitive locations, (e.g., national security, law enforcement facilities, and critical infrastructure), or disrupting normal air traffic operations resulting in runway changes, ground stops, pilot evasive action, etc. The report of a UAS operation alone does not constitute suspicious activity. Development of a comprehensive list of suspicious activities is not possible due to the vast number of situations that could be considered suspicious. ATC must exercise sound judgment when identifying situations that could constitute or indicate a suspicious activity.
