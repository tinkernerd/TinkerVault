[(See NAVIGATIONAL AID.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-n.html#$NAVIGATIONAL%20AID)

NAVAID CLASSES- VOR, VORTAC, and TACAN aids are classed according to their operational use. The three classes of NAVAIDs are:

1.  T- Terminal.
2.  L- Low altitude.
3.  H- High altitude.

Note: The normal service range for T, L, and H class aids is found in the AIM. Certain operational requirements make it necessary to use some of these aids at greater service ranges than specified. Extended range is made possible through flight inspection determinations. Some aids also have lesser service range due to location, terrain, frequency protection, etc. Restrictions to service range are listed in the Chart Supplement.

NAVIGABLE AIRSPACE- Airspace at and above the minimum flight altitudes prescribed in the CFRs including airspace needed for safe takeoff and landing.

(Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.)

NAVIGATION REFERENCE SYSTEM (NRS)- The NRS is a system of waypoints developed for use within the United States for flight planning and navigation without reference to ground based navigational aids. The NRS waypoints are located in a grid pattern along defined latitude and longitude lines. The initial use of the NRS will be in the high altitude environment. The NRS waypoints are intended for use by aircraft capable of point-to-point navigation.

NAVIGATION SPECIFICATION \[ICAO\]- A set of aircraft and flight crew requirements needed to support performance-based navigation operations within a defined airspace. There are two kinds of navigation specifications:

1.  RNP specification. A navigation specification based on area navigation that includes the requirement for performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the prefix RNP; e.g., RNP 4, RNP APCH.
2.  RNAV specification. A navigation specification based on area navigation that does not include the requirement for performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the prefix RNAV; e.g., RNAV 5, RNAV 1.

Note: The Performance-based Navigation Manual (Doc 9613), Volume II contains detailed guidance on navigation specifications.

NAVIGATIONAL AID- Any visual or electronic device airborne or on the surface which provides point-to-point guidance information or position data to aircraft in flight.
