ESTABLISHED- To be stable or fixed at an altitude or on a course, route, route segment, heading, instrument approach or departure procedure, etc.

ESTABLISHED ON RNP (EoR) CONCEPT- A system of authorized instrument approaches, ATC procedures, surveillance, and communication requirements that allow aircraft operations to be safely conducted with approved reduced separation criteria once aircraft are established on a PBN segment of a published instrument flight procedure.

ESTIMATED (EST)-When used in NOTAMs “EST” is a contraction that is used by the issuing authority only when the condition is expected to return to service prior to the expiration time. Using “EST” lets the user know that this NOTAM has the possibility of returning to service earlier than the expiration time. Any NOTAM which includes an “EST” will be auto-expired at the designated expiration time.

ESTIMATED ELAPSED TIME \[ICAO\]- The estimated time required to proceed from one significant point to another.

[(See ICAO term TOTAL ESTIMATED ELAPSED TIME.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-t.html#$TOTAL%20ESTIMATED%20ELAPSED%20TIME%20[ICAO])

ESTIMATED OFF-BLOCK TIME \[ICAO\]- The estimated time at which the aircraft will commence movement associated with departure.

ESTIMATED POSITION ERROR (EPE)-

[(See Required Navigation Performance.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$Required%20Navigation%20Performance)

ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL- The time the flight is estimated to arrive at the gate (scheduled operators) or the actual runway on times for nonscheduled operators.

ESTIMATED TIME EN ROUTE- The estimated flying time from departure point to destination (lift-off to touchdown).

**_EXECUTE MISSED APPROACH-_** Instructions issued to a pilot making an instrument approach which means continue inbound to the missed approach point and execute the missed approach procedure as described on the Instrument Approach Procedure Chart or as previously assigned by ATC. The pilot may climb immediately to the altitude specified in the missed approach procedure upon making a missed approach. No turns should be initiated prior to reaching the missed approach point. When conducting an ASR or PAR approach, execute the assigned missed approach procedure immediately upon receiving instructions to “execute missed approach.”

(Refer to AIM.)

**_EXPECT (ALTITUDE) AT (TIME) or (FIX)-_** Used under certain conditions to provide a pilot with an altitude to be used in the event of two-way communications failure. It also provides altitude information to assist the pilot in planning.

(Refer to AIM.)

EXPECT DEPARTURE CLEARANCE TIME (EDCT)- The runway release time assigned to an aircraft in a traffic management program and shown on the flight progress strip as an EDCT.

[(See GROUND DELAY PROGRAM.)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GROUND%20DELAY%20PROGRAM)

**_EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (TIME)-_** The time a pilot can expect to receive clearance beyond a clearance limit.

**_EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE VIA (AIRWAYS, ROUTES OR FIXES)-_** Used to inform a pilot of the routing he/she can expect if any part of the route beyond a short range clearance limit differs from that filed.

**_EXPEDITE-_** Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an imminent situation. Expedite climb/descent normally indicates to a pilot that the approximate best rate of climb/descent should be used without requiring an exceptional change in aircraft handling characteristics.
