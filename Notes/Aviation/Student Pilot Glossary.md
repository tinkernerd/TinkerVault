## Aviation Glossary

### A

**ABEAM** – An aircraft is “abeam” a fix, point, or object when it is approximately 90 degrees to the right or left of the aircraft track. Abeam indicates a general position rather than a precise point.

**ABORT** – To terminate a preplanned aircraft maneuver, e.g., an aborted takeoff.

**ACKNOWLEDGE** – Let me know that you have received and understood this message.

**ACROBATIC FLIGHT** – An intentional maneuver involving an abrupt change in an aircraft’s attitude, an abnormal attitude, or abnormal acceleration not necessary for normal flight.

**ADMINISTRATOR** – The Federal Aviation Administrator or any person delegated with authority in the matter concerned.

**ADVISE INTENTIONS** – Tell me what you plan to do.

**AERODROME** – A defined area on land or water (including buildings, installations, and equipment) intended for the arrival, departure, and movement of aircraft. (See **Airport**)

**AERODROME BEACON** – An aeronautical beacon used to indicate the location of an aerodrome from the air.

**AERONAUTICAL CHART** – A map used in air navigation containing topographic features, hazards, obstructions, navigation aids, navigation routes, designated airspace, and airports. Common types:

- **Sectional Aeronautical Charts (1:500,000)** – Designed for visual navigation of slow/medium-speed aircraft.
- **VFR Terminal Area Charts (1:250,000)** – Depict Class B airspace with topographic and aeronautical information.

**AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION MANUAL (AIM)** – An FAA publication instructing airmen on operating in the National Airspace System, including flight information, ATC procedures, flight safety, and aeronautical chart use.

**AFFIRMATIVE** – Yes.

**AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONE (ADIZ)** – An airspace area over land or water requiring aircraft identification, location, and control in the interest of national security. (Refer to AIM.)

**AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC)** – A service operated by the appropriate authority to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic.

**AIRMEN’S METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION (AIRMET)** – In-flight weather advisories issued to amend aviation forecasts concerning moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained winds over 30 knots, and widespread areas of low visibility or ceilings.

**AIRPORT** – An area on land or water used for the landing and takeoff of aircraft, including buildings and facilities.

**AIRPORT ELEVATION** – The highest point of an airport’s usable runways, measured in feet above mean sea level (MSL).

**ALTIMETER SETTING** – The barometric pressure reading used to adjust a pressure altimeter for variations in existing atmospheric pressure.

**ALTITUDE** – The height of a level, point, or object measured in feet above ground level (AGL) or from mean sea level (MSL).

### B

**BACK-TAXI** – A term used by ATC to instruct an aircraft to taxi on a runway in the opposite direction of normal traffic flow.

**BEARING** – The horizontal direction to or from any point, usually measured clockwise from true north, magnetic north, or another reference.

**BLOCKED** – Used to indicate a radio transmission was distorted or interrupted due to multiple simultaneous transmissions.

### C

**CARDINAL ALTITUDES** – “Odd” or “even” thousand-foot altitudes or flight levels, e.g., 5,000, 6,000, FL 250, FL 260.

**CEILING** – The height above the earth’s surface of the lowest cloud layer reported as “broken,” “overcast,” or “obscuration.”

**CHART SUPPLEMENT U.S.** – A pilot’s operational manual containing details on airports, seaplane bases, heliports, communications data, and special procedures.

**CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY** –

1. Taxiing aircraft: When all parts of the aircraft are held short of the runway holding position marking.
2. Exiting or crossing aircraft: When all parts of the aircraft are beyond the runway edge with no restrictions to continued movement.

**CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF** – ATC authorization for an aircraft to depart.

**CLEARED TO LAND** – ATC authorization for an aircraft to land.

### D

**DEAD RECKONING** – Navigation based solely on airspeed, course, heading, wind direction, groundspeed, and elapsed time.

**DEPARTURE CONTROL** – ATC function providing control service for departing IFR and certain VFR aircraft.

**DESIRED COURSE** – A predetermined direction to be followed, measured in degrees from true or magnetic north.

### E

**EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT)** – A radio transmitter that aids in locating downed aircraft by emitting a sweeping tone on emergency frequencies.

**EXPEDITE** – Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required to avoid an imminent situation.

### F

**FINAL** – Indicates an aircraft is aligned with a landing area on the final approach course.

**FIX** – A geographical position determined by visual reference, radio NAVAIDs, celestial plotting, or other navigation devices.

### G

**GO AHEAD** – Proceed with your message. Not used for other purposes.

**GO AROUND** – Instructions for a pilot to abandon an approach to landing and execute the missed approach procedure.

### H

**HANDOFF** – Transferring radar identification of an aircraft from one controller to another.

**HAVE NUMBERS** – Used by pilots to inform ATC they have received runway, wind, and altimeter information.

### I

**IDENT** – A request for a pilot to activate the aircraft transponder identification feature.

**IFR AIRCRAFT** – An aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR).

### L

**LAND AND HOLD SHORT OPERATIONS (LAHSO)** – Operations requiring an aircraft to land and hold short of an intersecting runway or taxiway.

### M

**MAYDAY** – The international radiotelephony distress signal, repeated three times to indicate imminent and grave danger.

### N

**NOTICE TO AIRMEN (NOTAM)** – A notice containing important flight information not known sufficiently in advance for public dissemination.

### R

**ROGER** – I have received all of your last transmission.

### V

**VFR AIRCRAFT** – An aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR).

**VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)** – Rules governing flight operations under visual meteorological conditions.
