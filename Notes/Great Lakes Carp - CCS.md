### Central Case Study: Leaping Fish, Backwards River: Asian Carp Threaten the Great Lakes

“We need to close the Asian carp superhighway, and do it now.”  
—Bill Schuette, Attorney General of Michigan

“This is not about Asian carp. This is about two artificially connected watersheds that many people argue never should have been connected.”  
—Peter Annin, Author and Great Lakes expert, Northland College

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sends electricity into the waters of the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal to stun fish swimming toward Lake Michigan, preventing invasive Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes. Asian carp were originally brought from China in the 1960s and 1970s to help control algae, snails, and plants in U.S. aquaculture ponds and wastewater facilities. Over time, they escaped into local waterways, found ample food, and grew too large for predators to control, resulting in rapid population growth. These carp now threaten native species, disrupt ecosystems, and alter water quality across many waterways in the southern U.S. and Midwest, including the Great Lakes region.

The invasive fish could potentially devastate the sport and commercial fisheries of the Great Lakes, which are worth billions. Efforts to control their spread include electric barriers, poisoning, and various physical measures to capture or block the fish. Over $400 million has been spent to prevent their advance.

In addition to Asian carp, the Great Lakes face threats from other invasive species, including sea lampreys and zebra mussels, which have also caused significant ecological and economic damage. Despite these efforts, there is uncertainty about whether the carp would survive if they reached the Great Lakes, due to the lake’s low nutrient levels and the carp’s need for flowing water to reproduce.
