## Question 4
**Explain what challenges Nigeria is facing.**

Nigeria is projected to become the third most populous nation by 2050. However, the country is facing significant challenges related to water scarcity. Lake Chad, a major water source, has shrunk due to climate change and withdrawals for agriculture, and the growing population will further strain water supplies. By 2050, Nigeria’s water supply per person may fall below the level classified as “water stressed,” leading to further economic and environmental difficulties.

## Question 5
**Compare the population pyramids of China in 1970, 2019, and 2050 (projected).**

- In **1970**, China's population pyramid had a broad base, indicating a high birth rate and a young population. This is typical of a developing country with rapid population growth.
- In **2019**, the base of the pyramid has narrowed, and the middle section has widened, reflecting a lower birth rate and an aging population. There are more individuals in the reproductive and post-reproductive age groups.
- In **2050 (projected)**, the pyramid is projected to have an even narrower base and a much wider top, indicating a significantly aging population with low birth rates and high life expectancy, which may lead to economic challenges due to a shrinking workforce.

## Question 6
**How can this information and 2050 projection help China prepare for the future?**

China's population projections for 2050 show a significant increase in the elderly population and a decrease in the working-age population. This demographic shift presents challenges such as a shrinking labor force, increased pressure on social services, and higher demand for healthcare and pension systems. To prepare for this, China can implement policies to support its aging population, such as:

1. **Pension and healthcare reforms** – Ensuring sustainable and efficient healthcare systems and pension funds to accommodate the growing elderly population.
2. **Encouraging higher birth rates** – Offering incentives for families to have more children, like tax benefits or improved parental leave policies.
3. **Immigration policies** – China could consider more open immigration policies to supplement its workforce and counterbalance the aging population.
4. **Investment in automation and AI** – As the labor force shrinks, investing in automation and AI could help maintain productivity levels in key industries.

## Question 7
**Explain five reasons why fertility rates remain high in developing countries and contrast that with the developed world.**

1. **Cultural expectations** – In many developing countries, having large families is a cultural norm, contributing to high fertility rates.
2. **Lack of access to contraception** – Limited access to birth control methods leads to higher fertility rates.
3. **Economic reliance on children** – Children are often seen as contributors to household labor or future income.
4. **Lack of education for women** – Lower education rates for women correlate with higher birth rates.
5. **High child mortality rates** – In regions where child mortality is high, families may have more children as a form of security.

In developed countries, these factors are generally less pronounced due to better access to education, contraception, and healthcare.

---

## Question 8
**Provide two examples of ways that the empowerment of women and the pursuit of gender equality have contributed to lower fertility rates in the developed world.**

1. **Increased access to education** – Educating women often leads to delayed childbirth and smaller families.
2. **Greater participation in the workforce** – Women who pursue careers tend to have fewer children due to time and financial constraints.

---

## Question 9
**Explain two ways that poverty negatively impacts the environment in the developing world.**

1. **Deforestation** – In poor regions, people often rely on wood for fuel, leading to deforestation.
2. **Overfarming** – Poverty can lead to overuse of land for farming, which degrades soil quality and reduces biodiversity.

---

## Question 10
**Explain two ways that affluence in the developed world negatively affects the environment.**

1. **High resource consumption** – Wealthier nations consume far more resources per capita, leading to depletion of natural resources.
2. **Increased pollution** – Affluent lifestyles tend to produce more waste and pollution due to higher energy use and consumer goods.

## Question 11
**In Brazil in the 1960s, the average woman in Brazil had six children. Today, the fertility rate is ______ children per woman.**

a.  
0.8  
b.  
***1.8***  
c.  
2.8  
d.  
3.8  
e.  
4.8

---

## Question 12
**Explain at least three reasons for the decline in fertility rate in Brazil.**

1. **Urbanization** – More people living in urban areas reduces the need for large families.
2. **Access to contraception** – Improved access to birth control has allowed women to have fewer children.
3. **Cultural shifts through media** – Soap operas and other media have shifted societal norms toward smaller families.

---

## Question 13
**Do you think that soap operas helped to decrease the fertility rate in Brazil?**

a.  
***Yes***  
b.  
No

## Question 14
**Response to Central Case Study: Will China’s New "Two-Child Policy" Defuse Its Population “Time Bomb”?**

### What initially contributed to China’s population growth?
China’s population growth was initially driven by Mao Zedong’s policies encouraging population growth. Improvements in food production, distribution, and public health also played a key role in allowing the population to swell from 540 million in 1949 to 790 million by 1970. During this period, Chinese women gave birth to an average of 5.8 children, and the population grew at an annual rate of 2.8%.

### What were the concerns about the growth that caused Chinese leaders to institute the “One Child Policy” in 1970?
By 1970, China’s rapid population growth was eroding the nation’s soils, depleting its water resources, and polluting its air. These environmental challenges, along with fears that the country would be unable to feed its growing population, led Chinese leaders to institute the “One Child Policy” to curb population growth.

### Was the “One Child Policy” successful in lowering the population growth rate?
Yes, the “One Child Policy” was successful in significantly lowering the population growth rate. China’s growth rate dropped from 2.8% to 0.5%, and the average number of children per woman decreased from 5.8 to 1.6. The policy drastically slowed population growth.

### Explain at least two unintended negative consequences of the policy?
1. **Aging population**: The rapid reduction in fertility rates has resulted in a shrinking labor force and a growing number of elderly citizens. This has put immense economic pressure on China, as there are fewer workers to support the elderly population.
2. **Gender imbalance**: Due to cultural preferences for sons, the policy led to selective abortion and infanticide of female babies, resulting in a highly skewed sex ratio, with too few women in comparison to men. This has created social instability and a large number of bachelors unable to find brides.

### Explain at least two issues that China is now facing due to the low fertility rate?
1. **Shrinking workforce**: With fewer children being born, the number of working-age individuals is decreasing, which puts pressure on China’s economic growth and increases labor costs.
2. **Rising elderly population**: The growing number of retirees is placing a burden on social services, healthcare systems, and the millions of only children who are responsible for caring for their aging parents.

### What changes to the original “One Child Policy” has China made to address these concerns? Explain.
In response to the challenges posed by the “One Child Policy,” China gradually relaxed the policy. In 2015, the government officially changed the policy to a “Two-Child Policy,” allowing all couples to have two children without penalty. However, the policy shift may have come too late, as many Chinese couples have become accustomed to smaller families and the material wealth that comes with having fewer children. Birth rates have only modestly increased since the policy change, and the government is considering further reforms, possibly scrapping all reproductive restrictions.
