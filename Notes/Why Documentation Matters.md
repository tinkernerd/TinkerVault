Documentation is essential for knowledge preservation and communication. It bridges the gap between raw information and actionable understanding.

## Benefits of Documentation
### 1. **Preservation**

- Prevents knowledge loss during transitions or turnover.

### 2. **Communication**
- Reduces misunderstandings and errors.
- Makes information accessible to diverse audiences.

### 3. **Productivity**
- Saves time by centralizing resources and answers.
- Streamlines onboarding and troubleshooting.

### 4. **Collaboration**
- Helps teams work together effectively.
- Encourages transparency and accountability.

## Real-World Examples
- **Software Development**: Code comments, README files, API docs.
- **Knowledge Management**: Wikis, team guides, meeting notes.
