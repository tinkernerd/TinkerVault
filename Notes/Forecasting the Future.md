## Enumerations, Estimates, and Projections of Population
The US Census Bureau provides three types of population data:

- **Enumerations**: Counts of the population (e.g., the 1990 census).
- **Estimates**: Recent population calculations based on the last census and changes since.
- **Projections**: Future population estimates based on the last census and assumptions about future trends.

## Population Estimates
The three components of population change are:
- Births (B)
- Deaths (D)
- Net migration (NIM + NDM)

Formula for population estimate: $P_{\text{New}} = P_{\text{Current}} + B - D + NIM + NDM$

### Example Calculation:
- Previous population: 31,785,857
- Births (B) = 4,708,894
- Deaths (D) = 1,810,698
- Net International Migration (NIM) = +2,019,488
- Net Domestic Migration (NDM) = -2,081,928

New population estimate: $P_{\text{New}} = 31,785,857 + 4,708,894 - 1,810,698 + 2,019,488 - 2,081,928 = 34,621,613$
## Population Projections

## Questions and Answers

1. Why are the population projections for the year 2030 larger when based on percent change than when based on numerical change for the 2010-2020 period
	**Answer**: Percent change grows the population faster because it compounds over time, while numerical change adds a fixed number of people.
2. For which of the first four states is the proportionate difference between the two projections the largest and why?
	**Answer**: Arizona has the biggest difference because it had the highest percent growth from 2010 to 2020.
3. How would you use the data in Table 1 to project population for states for the year 2040 assuming past trends in numerical population change?
	**Answer**: I would find the average yearly growth from 2010 to 2020, then multiply that by 20 years to project the population for 2040.
4. Explain why population projections are helpful to towns, cities, states, countries, and also businesses. What do they use the data for?
	**Answer**: Population projections help governments and businesses plan for the future, like preparing services, infrastructure, and understanding future demand for products and resources.
