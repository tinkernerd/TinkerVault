# Ecosystems: Biomass, Bioaccumulation, and Biomagnification


## PART 1

Estuaries and tidal marshes function as nutrient traps. This buildup of nutrients makes estuaries very productive environments but also renders estuaries vulnerable to the buildup of pollutants. In the following activity, you will calculate the biomass at different trophic levels in a simple estuary food web.

### Background Information:

A wildlife biologist discovered this information about a marsh food chain. Use the information below to solve the problems:

- A marsh hawk weighs 600 grams and eats 500 grams of seaside sparrows each week.
- Each sparrow weighs 20 grams and eats 40 grams of grasshoppers each week.
- Each grasshopper weighs 1 gram and eats 20 grams of cordgrass each week.
- Each cordgrass plant weighs 5 grams.

1.  How many sparrows must the marsh have to feed one hawk for a week?
	- **25 sparrows**  
  Calculation: Total weight of sparrows that one hawk eats / weight of one sparrow
2. How many grasshoppers must the marsh have to feed one sparrow for a week?
	- **40 grasshoppers**
3. How many cordgrass plants must the marsh have to feed one grasshopper for one week?
	- **4 plants**
4. How many grasshoppers are needed to feed the number of sparrows eaten by one hawk in a week?
	- **1,000 grasshoppers**  
	- Calculation: Number of sparrows needed to feed one hawk × number of grasshoppers needed to feed each sparrow
5. How many cordgrass plants are needed to feed all the grasshoppers that are eaten by all the sparrows that are eaten by one hawk in a week?
	- **4,000 cordgrass plants**
### Biomass Pyramid Populations based on 1 Hawk

| Number | Organism         |
|--------|------------------|
| 1      | Hawk             |
| 25     | Sparrows         |
| 1,000  | Grasshoppers     |
| 4,000  | Cordgrass Plants |
### Biomass Pyramid Populations based on 5 Hawks

| Number | Organism         |
|--------|------------------|
| 5      | Hawks            |
| 125    | Sparrows         |
| 5,000  | Grasshoppers     |
| 20,000 | Cordgrass Plants |
### Questions

1. An estuary is a nutrient trap. Name one way in which this helps the plants and animals that live in the estuary.
	- It helps because the nutrients are available when plants and animals need them.
2. State one way in which people can cause the nutrient trap to become harmful to the animals in the estuary.
	- Pollutants and runoff can disrupt the balance and harm animals.
3. Cordgrass, planthoppers, and spiders are part of a food chain in a salt marsh. Spiders eat planthoppers, and planthoppers eat cordgrass. Which organism from this food chain has the smallest number living in the marsh? (Hint: Draw a biomass pyramid – what organisms are at the top of the pyramid?)
	- Spiders (top of the food chain)
4. Which organism in the food chain from question #8 has the largest number living in the marsh?
	- Cordgrass (bottom of the food chain)

## PART 2
In part 2, you will read about bioaccumulation and biomagnification in food chains. In addition, you will read about a specific pollutant, DDT, and watch a video about a current problem we have with the biomagnification of mercury in food webs.

### Overview

You have learned how energy is transferred among organisms in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is an open system because energy is constantly entering the system in the form of sunlight (though energy is also leaving the system). You likely noticed the pattern of energy transfer in this system: how the number of organisms in each trophic level decreases as you travel higher up the food pyramid.

Plants transfer one-tenth (0.1) of their energy to primary consumers. Primary consumers transfer one-tenth of the energy they take in (0.01 of the original energy in plants) to secondary consumers; and tertiary consumer get one-tenth (0.001) of that. Therefore, when a tertiary consumer eats a secondary consumer, it is indirectly also eating the primary consumers that the secondary consumer ate, as well as the primary producers the primary consumer ate. The top-level consumers thus consume substances that have been passed through all levels of the food chain.

What does this imply for top-level consumers in an ecosystem that is polluted with toxins? How do pollutants affect the food web? How do the toxins get passed from one organism to another? Finally, how do these pollutants accumulate in top-level consumers, and what effect does it have on them and the rest of the food web?

Bioaccumulation refers to the buildup of toxins in the bodies of organisms in a food chain. These toxins become concentrated in the primary producers, or green plants. A toxin is considered to be “concentrated” when there is more of it in an organism, like a plant, than in the environment. This happens primarily when the pollutant resembles inorganic nutrients that plants need. The plants take in the pollutant and store it in their tissues.

Biomagnification follows bioaccumulation. Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of these toxins as they are passed on to animals higher in the food chain. For example, a toxin absorbed by the primary producers is passed to the primary consumers. Primary consumers eat many plants, so they take in lots of the toxin and store it in their body. When primary consumers are eaten by the secondary consumers, the secondary consumers ingest the toxins from all the plants the primary consumer ate. Tertiary consumers eat many secondary consumers, and so ingest toxins from all lower trophic levels---the equivalent of toxins from many, many thousands of plants. Thus, toxins become highly concentrated in animals at the highest trophic levels. These toxins can reach harmful levels and even kill the top-level organisms.

In order for biomagnification to occur, a pollutant must meet four conditions:
1. It must be long-lived
2. It must be mobile
3. It must be soluble in body fats
4. It must be biologically active (harmful to the organism)

If the toxin is short-lived, it can be broken down into harmless substances in an organism that ingests it. This prevents the toxin from being passed on. If the toxin is not mobile--does not easily move through the environment---it will be hard for organisms to get to and consume it. Therefore, it will not enter the food chain. If the toxin is soluble in water instead of fat, it will leave the organism’s body through sweat and urine, and thus not be passed on. A fat-soluble toxin remains in an organism, and is stored with fat. If the toxin is not biologically active, it will have no effect on the organism, since it does not harm the organism. The pollutant may accumulate, but it will not affect the organism.
### A Classic Example

A classic example of biomagnification involves birds and the chemical DDT---an insecticide that was used for many years before we realized its toxic nature. DDT (dichloro, diphenyl trichlorethane) was discovered and first used in the mid-1900s, to kill mosquitoes. 

Certain mosquitoes carry malaria, an often deadly disease common in tropical countries. Prior to DDT, there was little protection against disease-carrying mosquitoes, and the disease was rampant. To control the mosquitoes, vast quantities of DDT were produced and then sprayed over wet areas where disease-carrying mosquitoes bred. Inevitably, the DDT washed into streams, and eventually into lakes and rivers. At first, its effects went unnoticed. The DDT was taken up with nutrients by zooplankton--tiny water animals--from the bottom of lakes and rivers. At this point, DDT was at relatively low concentrations.

Fish then ate the DDT-ridden zooplankton. Now fish have to eat a lot of zooplankton to get the same amount of energy as the zooplankton got from nutrients. So the fish consumed a greater concentration of DDT because they got some from each minute zooplankton they ate. Suppose, for example, each zooplankton contains 1 bit of DDT. It passes one-tenth of it (0.1 bits) on to fish. Assuming each fish eats 1,000 zooplankton a day, each fish ingests 100 bits of DDT daily. The DDT is stored in the fish’s fatty tissues. Over its lifetime, huge quantities of DDT accumulate in the fish. However, the DDT does not yet show signs of harming the contaminated fish.

Further up the food web, the contaminated fish are eaten by birds, particularly top-level predators such as eagles, ospreys, and other birds of prey. Again, the eagle must eat more fish per eagle than the fish had to eat zooplankton per fish. For example, suppose an eagle eats two one-year-old fish per day. Each young fish contains 36,500 bits of DDT. So one eagle ingests 73,000 bits of DDT daily--and the DDT is stored in the bird’s body. By the time it gets to organisms at the top of the trophic food chain, the DDT will have magnified, or multiplied enormously.

To make a long story short, by the 1960s, eagles and other birds of prey were on the brink of extinction. The DDT in their bodies caused females to produce eggs with extremely thin shells. The populations of these birds crashed because shells broke during incubation, so the population was not replenished. Since the banning of DDT, some of these bird species have recovered, and their numbers have increased. 

A similar process may be occurring in the Florida upland ecosystem, where raccoons feed on large fish and Florida panthers feed on raccoons. Conservationists are concerned about the panther, because high levels of DDT (which persists for decades in the environment) and/or mercury (a highly toxic, even deadly heavy metal pollutant) in fish can accumulate in raccoons and be passed on to the highly endangered panther.

### Questions

1. Explain bioaccumulation and biomagnification.
- Bioaccumulation is the process where toxins build up in an organism's body over time, typically because the organism absorbs the toxins faster than it can eliminate them. Biomagnification occurs when these toxins become more concentrated as they move up the food chain, with top-level predators accumulating the highest levels of toxins from eating multiple contaminated organisms. This can lead to harmful effects, especially in species at higher trophic levels.

2.  In a few sentences, summarize the issues that DDT caused in our ecosystems and why.
- DDT caused significant harm to ecosystems by accumulating in top predators, such as birds of prey. It led to the thinning of eggshells, causing them to break during incubation, which resulted in population declines. The widespread use of DDT was initially to control mosquitoes, but its persistence in the environment and movement up the food chain caused unintended and severe impacts on wildlife, particularly in higher trophic levels.

3.  In a few sentences, summarize the issues we are currently facing related to mercury in the Amazon.
- In the Amazon, mercury pollution from gold mining is accumulating in fish, which are then eaten by both wildlife and humans. This mercury bioaccumulates in the food chain and biomagnifies in top predators, such as jaguars and large fish-eating animals, leading to toxic levels. This poses serious health risks for both local wildlife and indigenous communities that rely on these fish for food, threatening ecosystems and human health alike.

4.  Explain why animals at the top of the food chain are more vulnerable to pollution than those at lower trophic levels.
- Animals at the top of the food chain are more vulnerable to pollution because they consume multiple organisms from lower trophic levels, leading to the accumulation of toxins in their bodies. As pollutants move up the food chain, they become more concentrated in these top predators through a process called biomagnification. This makes top-level consumers more likely to suffer from harmful effects of toxins than organisms at lower levels.
