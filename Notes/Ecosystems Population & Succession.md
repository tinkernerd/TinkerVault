# Environmental Science Assignment Review

## 1. Describe how limiting factors relate to carrying capacity.
Limiting factors, such as food, water, and habitat availability, restrict the growth of populations by preventing them from increasing indefinitely. These factors help set the carrying capacity (K), which is the maximum population size an environment can support sustainably.

---

## 2. Provide two ways in which we have raised Earth’s carrying capacity for humans.
1. Advancements in agriculture (e.g., the Green Revolution) have increased food production, allowing more people to be sustained.
2. Improvements in healthcare and technology have reduced mortality rates and increased life expectancy.

---

## 3. Provide two limiting factors that still exist for the human population today.
1. **Water availability:** Many regions face water shortages, which limit how many people can live in those areas.
2. **Space/land availability:** Overpopulation in urban areas leads to overcrowding, competition for resources, and decreased quality of life.

## 4. "A stereotypical series of changes as an ecological community develops over time, beginning with a lifeless substrate" is:
- **a. Primary succession** (Correct)
- b. Secondary succession

---

## 5. "A stereotypical series of changes experienced by an ecological community as it develops over time, beginning when some disturbance disrupts or dramatically alters an existing community" is:
- a. Primary succession
- **b. Secondary succession** (Correct)

---

## 6. Lichens inhabiting a bare substrate is an example of:
- **a. Primary succession** (Correct)
- b. Secondary succession

---

## 7. After a fire, the soil is nutrient-rich, and pioneer species of plants can germinate. This process is called:
- a. Primary succession
- **b. Secondary succession** (Correct)

---

## 8. What are Asian Carp, and why were they brought to the United States?
Asian carp are a group of four species of fish (black carp, grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp) that were imported to the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s to control algae, parasites, and plants in aquaculture ponds and wastewater treatment systems.

## 9. How has the Asian Carp population been able to grow so quickly in our bodies of water?  
The carp have thrived in U.S. waterways due to abundant food and a lack of natural predators. Their rapid reproduction and large size make them difficult for predators to catch, allowing their population to grow unchecked.

---

## 10. What are two concerns related to the Asian Carp here in the Great Lakes region?
1. **Disruption of ecosystems:** The carp compete with native species for food and habitats, potentially disrupting the Great Lakes’ ecosystems.
2. **Economic damage:** They threaten the $7 billion sport and commercial fishing industry by altering aquatic food chains and habitats.

## 11. Name two other invasive species in Great Lakes.
1. Zebra mussels
2. Sea lamprey

## 12. How do you think abiotic and biotic factors in the forest will be impacted by fire?  
Abiotic factors like soil composition and temperature can improve due to the release of nutrients from burned organic material. Biotic factors, such as plant regeneration, are stimulated as fire clears dead material, allowing new growth and increasing biodiversity. For example, some fire-adapted plants and trees flourish after a fire.

---

## 13. How does fire help Lodgepole and Jack Pine trees complete their life cycles?  
Lodgepole and Jack Pine trees have serotinous cones that only open after being exposed to the high heat of a fire. Fire helps these trees regenerate by allowing their seeds to reach the nutrient-rich soil left behind after a burn.

---

## 14. Besides serotiny, why are forest fires important for ecosystem health?  
Fires help remove dead vegetation, recycle nutrients, and reduce competition for sunlight among plants. This encourages plant diversity, maintains ecosystem balance, and supports the growth of fire-adapted species.

---

## 15. Define "evolution."
Evolution is the gradual process where species change over time as they adapt to their environment. These changes happen because of genetic variations, which allow some individuals to thrive and pass their traits on to future generations.

---

## 16. Explain how evolution generates biodiversity.
Evolution leads to biodiversity by allowing species to adapt to different environmental conditions. As species evolve and develop unique traits, they fill new ecological roles and niches, increasing the variety of life forms in an ecosystem.
