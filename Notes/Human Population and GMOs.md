# Genetically Modified Foods Activity - Questions and Answers

**Background:**

Our growing global human population has caused a higher demand for food resources. One way to handle this increase in demand is the use of genetically modified food. In this activity, you will read about genetically modified foods and weigh the positive and negative impacts of these foods as they relate to meeting this growing need.

## Instructions: Answer the following questions.

1. **What is genetic engineering?**

   Genetic engineering is the process whereby scientists directly manipulate an organism’s genetic material in the laboratory by adding, deleting, or changing stretches of DNA. It is one form of biotechnology, the material application of biological science to create products derived from organisms.

2. **What are genetically modified organisms (GMOs)?**

   Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms that have been genetically altered using genetic engineering techniques. These organisms can include crops and livestock that have had specific genes added or modified to improve traits such as resistance to pests, higher yields, or enhanced nutritional content.

3. **What is recombinant DNA?**

   Recombinant DNA is DNA that has been formed by combining DNA from different organisms. This is a key technique used in genetic engineering to introduce new genes into organisms, including crops and livestock.

4. **Explain the difference between traditional selective breeding techniques and recombinant DNA techniques.**

   Traditional selective breeding involves choosing organisms with desirable traits and breeding them over generations to enhance those traits in offspring. Recombinant DNA techniques, on the other hand, involve directly modifying the organism’s DNA in a laboratory by adding or removing genes, allowing for much more precise and immediate changes.

5. **Explain how genetically modified crops are produced to enable them to be more resistant to insect attacks.**

   Genetically modified crops are often engineered by incorporating genes that produce proteins toxic to certain pests. For example, Bt crops contain genes from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis*, which produces a protein that kills insect larvae when they ingest it, making the crops resistant to insect attacks.

6. **Provide 2 reasons why GMOs are viewed favorably.**

   - GMOs can increase crop yields, allowing farmers to produce more food from the same amount of land.
   - GMOs can enhance nutritional content, such as Golden Rice, which is engineered to contain higher levels of Vitamin A.

7. **Provide 2 environmental concerns associated with GMOs.**

   - There are concerns that GMOs could crossbreed with wild plants, potentially leading to the spread of modified genes in the environment.
   - GMOs may encourage the development of pesticide-resistant insects or herbicide-resistant weeds, potentially leading to increased chemical use.

8. **Review about the organisms described in Table 10.1.**

   (a) **What are Bt crops and what are the concerns about them?**

   Bt crops are genetically modified to produce a toxin from *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) that kills certain insects. The concerns about Bt crops include the potential for insects to develop resistance to the Bt toxin over time, which could reduce the effectiveness of the crops and require additional pest management strategies.

   (b) **What are Roundup Ready crops and what are the concerns about them?**

   Roundup Ready crops are genetically modified to be resistant to glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup. The concerns about these crops include the possibility of glyphosate-resistant weeds developing, which would make weed control more difficult and lead to increased herbicide use.

9. **What countries are aggressively pursuing GM crops and why?**

   Countries like the United States, Brazil, and Argentina are aggressively pursuing GM crops because these crops can improve agricultural efficiency, increase yields, and help meet the growing global demand for food. GM crops can also reduce the need for chemical inputs like pesticides and herbicides, potentially lowering production costs.

10. **What is the “precautionary principle”? When considering GMOs, do you agree or disagree with experts that feel we should adopt the precautionary principle? Explain your answer.**

   The “precautionary principle” is the idea that new technologies or innovations, such as GMOs, should not be widely adopted until their long-term risks and effects are fully understood. I personally agree with adopting the precautionary principle when it comes to GMOs, as the potential risks to human health and the environment could be significant. While GMOs offer many benefits, it is important to ensure that we thoroughly understand and mitigate any unintended consequences before allowing their widespread use.
