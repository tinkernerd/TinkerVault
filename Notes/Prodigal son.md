## The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32)

### Summary
In this parable, Jesus tells the story of a father with two sons. The younger son demands his inheritance early, leaves home, and squanders his wealth in a distant land on reckless living. When a severe famine strikes, he finds himself destitute and hires himself out to feed pigs, an occupation that leaves him so hungry he longs to eat the pigs’ food. Realizing his mistakes, he decides to return home, intending to ask his father to take him back as a servant.

Upon seeing him from afar, the father runs to embrace his son, welcoming him back with love and compassion. The father orders a celebration, saying, "This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found." Meanwhile, the elder son, who has been dutifully working at home, feels resentment over the celebration for his brother. His father gently reminds him that everything he has belongs to him, but they must celebrate because his brother has returned.

### Themes and Insights

1. **Forgiveness and Grace**  
   The father’s unconditional forgiveness represents God’s boundless grace. Despite the younger son’s choices, the father welcomes him back with open arms, celebrating his return rather than condemning him for his past. This illustrates God’s readiness to forgive and rejoice when anyone turns back to Him.

2. **Repentance and Humility**  
   The younger son’s journey from pride to humility shows the process of repentance. By acknowledging his wrongs and returning to his father, he displays a heart willing to change. His return reflects the human experience of recognizing one’s shortcomings and seeking forgiveness.

3. **The Elder Son’s Resentment**  
   The elder son’s reaction reveals the danger of self-righteousness. While he outwardly followed the rules, his resentment toward his brother reveals a heart that doesn’t fully grasp the depth of his father’s love. This serves as a reminder that a rigid focus on duty without love and compassion can lead to bitterness.

4. **Celebration of Restoration**  
   The father's call for a feast emphasizes the joy of restoration and the value placed on every person. In God’s eyes, no one is beyond redemption. The celebration marks the restoration of a relationship, highlighting that God’s desire is not to punish but to welcome, restore, and bring joy to all who come to Him.
