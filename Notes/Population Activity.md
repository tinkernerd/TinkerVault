# How can human activities affect populations over time?
## Part 1: Case Study – Deer Management on Arizona’s Kaibab Plateau

In 1906, the U.S. Forest Service began protecting a herd of deer on a 300,000-hectare range on Arizona’s Kaibab Plateau. In previous years, the Kaibab forest area had been overgrazed by cattle, sheep, and horses. 

The Forest Service’s data is shown below:

| Year | Population | Year | Population |
|------|------------|------|------------|
| 1905 | 4,000      | 1927 | 37,000     |
| 1910 | 9,000      | 1928 | 35,000     |
| 1915 | 25,000     | 1929 | 30,000     |
| 1920 | 65,000     | 1930 | 25,000     |
| 1924 | 100,000    | 1931 | 20,000     |
| 1925 | 60,000     | 1935 | 18,000     |
| 1926 | 40,000     | 1939 | 10,000     |

### Questions:

1. **Define “carrying capacity.”**  
   Carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species that an environment can sustain indefinitely, given the available resources such as food, habitat, water, and other necessities.
2. **How did the deer population size in the years listed below compare to the carrying capacity? Indicate whether the population size was higher, lower, or at the carrying capacity.**

   a) **1915**: Lower (25,000 compared to the carrying capacity of 30,000)  
   b) **1920**: Higher (65,000 compared to the carrying capacity of 30,000)  
   c) **1924**: Higher (100,000 compared to the carrying capacity of 30,000)

3. **Explain how the deer population size changed as a result of the following actions taken by the Forest Service.**

   a) **In 1907, the Forest Service banned deer hunting and exterminated natural predators.**  
   The deer population increased rapidly due to the lack of natural predators and hunting restrictions, reaching an unsustainable level by the 1920s.

   b) **In 1921, the Forest Service reduced grazing permits for livestock.**  
   This action likely had minimal immediate effect on the deer population, but it aimed to reduce competition for food on the range.

   c) **In 1924, deer hunting was allowed again due to the brink of starvation.**  
   The deer population declined as hunting resumed, but this was necessary to prevent further environmental degradation and starvation.

4. **What do you think the Forest Service learned between 1905 and 1939?**  
   The Forest Service likely learned that predator-prey dynamics and human intervention, such as hunting bans and predator extermination, can drastically affect population sizes. They also recognized the importance of maintaining balance in ecosystems, especially in terms of carrying capacity and resource availability.

## Part 2: Michigan Wolf Hunt

Michigan held the first wolf hunt in more than 50 years in 2013. The DNR approved the hunting of 43 wolves in 3 designated zones in the Upper Peninsula between November 16th and December 31st. The wolf population had risen to over approximately 658, and the department believed the hunt would decrease the aggressive behavior of the wolves and prevent further killing of livestock and pets. During the hunt, 23 wolves were killed. Local Indian tribes and organizations, such as Keep Michigan Wolves Protected, protested the hunt because they believe that the people of Michigan should vote on the wolf hunt. One Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe member explained that the wolf has “spiritual and historical significance to the tribe.”

### Questions:

1. **Do you believe that there should be wolf hunting in Michigan? Explain why or why not.**

   I believe wolf hunting should only be allowed if it's necessary to manage the population or prevent serious conflicts with livestock and pets. Wolves are important for maintaining balance in the ecosystem by controlling prey populations, and they hold spiritual significance for many Native American tribes. Any decision to allow hunting should be backed by scientific evidence and carefully regulated to avoid harming the long-term health of the wolf population and the environment.

2. **Do you believe that there should be a referendum so that Michigan residents have a chance to vote on whether or not to allow the hunting of wolves, or should this decision be left up to the DNR? Explain your answer.**

   I think a combination of both public input and expert guidance is important. A referendum would allow Michigan residents to express their views, but the DNR should ultimately use its scientific expertise to make the final decision. It's important to consider not only public opinion but also the need for careful wildlife management to ensure that wolves and their environment are sustainably protected. Additionally, consulting with tribal communities is essential due to their cultural connection to the species.

## Part 3: Yellowstone and Isle Royale Wolf Reintroductions

Throughout history, humans have eradicated species that we find threatening to ourselves and our livestock. Since then, we have learned the vital role that these top predators play in their food webs by maintaining the balance among species in the web. Ecologists have begun to reintroduce these species into their original habitats. These reintroductions are controversial. Currently, wolves are being reintroduced to the Isle Royale National Park in Michigan. We have also reintroduced wolves into Yellowstone National Park.

### Questions:

1. **What are the main arguments for wolf reintroduction?**

   The main arguments for wolf reintroduction include restoring balance to the ecosystem. Wolves, as apex predators, help regulate prey populations, which can prevent overgrazing and promote biodiversity. For example, in Yellowstone, wolves helped control the elk population, which allowed vegetation to recover and positively impacted other species like beavers and birds. Wolves also contribute to the natural balance of food webs by influencing the behavior and distribution of other animals.

2. **What are the main arguments against wolf reintroduction?**

   The main arguments against wolf reintroduction often center on concerns for human safety, livestock losses, and potential conflicts with local economies. Ranchers and farmers worry that wolves will attack livestock, leading to financial losses. Additionally, some people are concerned that wolves may pose a threat to pets or even humans. There is also the cost of managing and monitoring the reintroduced populations, which some argue could be better spent on other conservation efforts.

3. **Based on your understanding of ecosystems, do you think that we should reintroduce predators to their original habitats? Explain why or why not.**

   Yes, I believe reintroducing predators to their original habitats can be beneficial for ecosystems. Predators like wolves play a crucial role in maintaining the natural balance of ecosystems by keeping prey populations in check, which allows vegetation and other species to thrive. While reintroduction efforts must be carefully managed to address concerns such as livestock predation, the long-term benefits of restoring ecosystems often outweigh the short-term challenges. Restoring top predators can help bring ecosystems back to a healthier, more natural state.
