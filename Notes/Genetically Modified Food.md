# Genetically Modified Food

Genetically Modified Food  
Industrial agriculture has enabled us to feed a greater number and proportion of the world’s people, but relentless population growth and intensified environmental impacts are demanding further innovation. Modern advances in genetics have enabled scientists to directly alter the genes of organisms, including crop plants and livestock. The genetic modification of organisms that provide us food and fiber holds considerable promise to enhance nutrition and the efficiency of agriculture while reducing impacts on ecosystems.

Any process whereby scientists directly manipulate an organism’s genetic material in the laboratory by adding, deleting, or changing stretches of DNA is referred to as genetic engineering. Genetic engineering is one form of biotechnology, the material application of biological science to create products derived from organisms. Biotechnology has brought our society a dazzling array of advances, helping us develop medicines, clean up pollution, understand the causes of cancer and other diseases, dissolve blood clots after heart attacks, and even make better beer and cheese. Yet many people worry that genetically engineered organisms may pose risks that are not yet fully understood. Moreover, the expanding role of biotechnology in agriculture has strengthened the influence of multinational corporations over farmers and our food supply. For these reasons, agricultural biotechnology, particularly genetic engineering, has faced resistance from many consumer advocates, small farmers, and critics of big business.
