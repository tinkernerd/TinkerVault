# Automation

Why do something yourself when a script can do it better, faster, and without complaining? This section is your go-to for automation tools and practices. We’re starting with Ansible, but there’s plenty more to come, so keep an eye out.

## Topics

```dataview  
TABLE WITHOUT ID  
link(file.path, title) AS "Note", type as Type, dateCreated as "Date Created", 
file.mtime AS "Last modified"  
FROM #Automation AND "Notes"
SORT title ASC
```
## Coming Soon

- **Terraform**: Automate your infrastructure with the power of code.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipelines that’ll make your deployments smoother than a Zamboni’d ice rink.
- **Puppet**: Keeping your servers in line, like a drill sergeant.
- **PowerShell**: Automating your Windows systems like a pro.
