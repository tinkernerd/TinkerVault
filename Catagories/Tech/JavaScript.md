# JavaScript
Welcome to the JavaScript section! Here’s where I keep all the important notes and examples from class, as well as some project links and resources. Whether you're here to brush up on functions or dive into class materials, you’re in the right spot.

```dataview  
TABLE WITHOUT ID  
link(file.path, title) AS "Note", type as Type, dateCreated as "Date Created", 
file.mtime AS "Last modified"  
FROM #javascript  AND "Notes"
SORT title ASC
```

## Class Notes

Checkout the [Git Repo for ISYS115](https://github.com/tinkernerd/ISYS115) for all the code from class. Important notes and examples from the course will make their way here over time.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to add content from class and personal projects.
