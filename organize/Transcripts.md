**If a student calls and asks about transcripts and they say that they are having trouble with ordering them, here is a step-by-step to get them at [getmytranscript.com](https://www.getmytranscript.com).**



1.  First, they need to put in the school they want to transcripts from the school in question. Most of the time it'll be from here: Southwestern Michigan College.



a.  If they need transcripts from their high school, they need to speak to the secretary at that high school to get them.

2.  This screen just tells them that it is a $5 per copy cost for transcripts. They just need to select "Order Transcripts" from this point.



a.  They also note here if the student has listed the correct college, that if they have any issues with this, they can get ahold of records. However, there is an issue with the records department where they aren't getting the student's transcript information because of them no longer being an active student. Daryl confirmed that this is incorrect. But until they can get their stuff together, we have this guide.



![School Notifications PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM SMC: For the fastest delivery of your official SMC transcript, choose to deliver your transcript electronically to your recipient.

3.  This is the personal information page. This asks for your first name, last name, age, as well as your student ID number for that school. If the student no longer has access to that student ID number and doesn't want to use their Social Security Number in place of it, then they need to speak to advising to get that N-Number. Otherwise, this just clarifies that you are you and you get your transcripts.

4.  This is the personal information continued. This just includes asking for the student's contact information whether by mail, email, or SMS.

5.  Here it asks for the recipient of the transcript. This step-by-step covers sending it to yourself through mail or email. So, if you want to see what you would need to do for the others, just go through the link and test it for yourself.



![Select Transcript and Delivery Details Recipient All fields required, unless otherwise indicated According to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), in certain instances, schools must obtain the student's permission in orderto release information from his or her educational records. The type of consent form that is required is determined by recipient type. College or University Education Organization, Application Service, Scholarship and Professional Licensing Employer or Other Myself ](../../Attachments/Help-Desk-Transcripts-image5.png){width="5.0in" height="1.71875in"}



6.  Here after selecting "Myself" you are able to select where to send it and other documents you would like to attach when sending the transcript(s). This step-by-step doesn't need any other documents, so we'll go ahead and select which one is most convenient (If the student needs to save money, then they can go ahead and get the copy sent to them electronically and only pay $5 and print it at home)



![Select Transcript and Delivery Details Send processing Details All fields required, unless otherwise indicated When do you want your transcript processed? Current Transcript - Process As Is NOTE: This option is for students and alumni who want their transcript processed and sent as it is today.

a.  If the student wants the transcript sent to them through mail, here is what the page would look like for them before payments (notice that it reminds the student again that the cost is $5 per copy in these screen captures):

b.  This is how it would look like if the student wants their transcript sent to them through email. The information auto fills from the step where it asks for the contact information



i.  Again, they note that the copy is $5 per copy. So, if a student tells you that they didn't see that, let them know, politely, what steps it would be that it states that it is indeed $5 per copy (electronic gets only one copy in a pdf format so you can print it off as many times as needed and send it wherever you want to):

7.  From there, it should be the billing information, and that should be straight forward and if they have questions about how to fill it in, pretend to request a transcript with them and walk them through it. Not ideal, but it helps and we get a good response from someone.
