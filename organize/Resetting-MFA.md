![Help Desk Training Resetting MFA Helping students (and Staff/Faculty) to reset their MFA is another very frequent duty for the Help Desk. MFA Reset can only be changed while speaking to the person requesting the change. In-person requests are the best, but we also work with users who are on the phone. We do not reset MFA with email or ticket requests only _ 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) Collect the information a) First and Last Name. b) Login name (if possible). c) Student ID Number. This is NOT optional! i) If they do not have their Student ID number connect them to Academic Advising (x. 1 303), or give them the number to call. On the Wired page, click on the link labeled, "Wired Admin Password Maintenance for Student Accounts" on the right-hand side of the screen under the heading Helpful Links. Enter the Banner number and click Search. Ask the user for their full name and birthdate. Verify the information is correct. Click on the user name. Click the large, blue button labeled Reset MFA/Account Recovery. The account is reset. The user can now login and setup MFA on their own. ](../../Attachments/Help-Desk-Resetting-MFA-image1.png){width="8.5in" height="11.0in"}
