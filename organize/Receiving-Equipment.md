New Equipment is to be placed on, under or near the Receiving Table in the back room (Wood 444).



Enter the equipment into the Inventory System (as of October 2020 the program is *AssetTiger*).



Ensure that the proper labels are applied.

1 Barcode on the main piece.

1 Matching barcode on the outside of the equipment box.

Reference labels on any other equipment that could get separated from the unit so they can be put together again at a later time (i.e., label any external power supply with the name and model number of the main unit).



Tape a colored label on the outside of the box near the barcode.

The colors are assigned according to the project. For example, light green is Podium Refresh. Dark blue is networking.

The label must have the project name at the top.

Make sure a brief description of the equipment is on the label.

Mark the date the equipment was received on the label.

When the piece is actually added to the inventory database, place a checkmark in the "Tagged" field.

Note any damage in the "Comments" field.



Place the equipment, with the barcode and the colored tag, on the orange holding shelves. Most projects have an area, so place the equipment in the corresponding spot. Excess inventory may be stored on the top shelves.
