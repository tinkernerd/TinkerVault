This is the batch file to reset the computer IP to DHCP.



This is the batch file to setup the computer for Camera access. Note that each individual filename begins with the name of the computer (although only one file is shown here), and the **netsh** line static IP needs to be for that computer; i.e., **NMAIN0149L01** needs to have a static IP of 172.22.17.**101** (the number of the computer, **01** + **100.)** Computer **L07** will have an IP of 172.22.17**.107**.
