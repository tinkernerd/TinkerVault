Good morning,



So that we can have accurate data from Help Desk tickets, we have developed a procedure to close tickets when the user is unresponsiveafter a fix has been implemented.



1, After a request is sent to the user telling them that the issue has been resolved and we would like a verification from them that the fix worked, we will wait 2 weeks for a response. (This accounts for if the user is on vacation.)

  - Please add a note to the ticket that you sent a request for verification.



2. After two weeks, we will send a second communication requesting verification that the issue is resolved.

  - Please add a notestating that no reply hasbeen received and you are sending a second request.



3. After three working days (Monday through Friday), theticket will be closed if there is no response. 

  - Please add a note that the user is unresponsivebefore closing the ticket.



If you have any questions, please let me know.



Thank you,

Diana
