![Help Desk Training Printing Printing at Southwestern Michigan College is accomplished using a system called PaperCut_ PaperCut tracks printing charges, and allows one to print to a print queue, and then print the hard copy at any PaperCut MFP (Multi-Function Printer) on either the Dowagiac or Niles campus. 1) 2) PaperCut is set up for buo groups. a) Students. b) Faculty and Staff (through Department Codes). Students who work for the College can sometimes choose which system to use for printing. a) This has to be explicitly set up. Talk to a Help Desk person with PaperCut Admin credentials for this. 3) When someone uses the printer system for the first time, they may geta message saying they need to associate their ID with their login _ This is legitimate. Just use your Wired credentials. Y ou should only have to do this one time. a) There is a Special Case where a person may need to associate more than once. We updated printers recently; if someone logs into a new printer, then later logs into an old printer, they will be asked to associate buice_ The same happens when moving from an old printer to a new one. i) If this happens, contact a Help Desk person with PaperCut Admin credentials. They can make a change in the system to prevent this. ](../../Attachments/Help-Desk-Printing-image1.png){width="8.5in" height="11.0in"}
