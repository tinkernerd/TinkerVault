We are using single labels to mark equipment. This label has the college name along the top of the label, the inventory number barcode in the middle and the human-readable inventory number under the barcode.

Reference labels are placed on any equipment parts that may be separated from the main unit; I.e., a power supply for a laptop computer. These labels have the college name along the top of the label and the main part name and model in a larger, bold font below.
