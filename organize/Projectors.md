![Help Desk Training Projectors We have projectors in all classrooms on both campuses, as well as in some special area (for example, meeting rooms). Most are Epson brand projectors, but some older other-brand projectors are still in some areas. These older projectors are being phased out for Epsons_ We have a couple programs we used to manage the Epson projectors. 1) Epson iManage - This is a Windows-based app that allows us to real-time monitor and control projectors across both campuses from workstations. 2) Epson iProjection - This is an app that allows users limited control over projectors; i.e., individual projectors can be linked and/or controlled on a temporary basis. a) The apps is both Windows and Mac based. b) The app is also available for iOS and Android. A large majority of tickets will be from users who have projector issues. Usually they have trouble getting the projector to project what is on the computer screen _ Typical fixes are: 1) Have the projector search for the signal from the computer. To do this just push the "Input" button on the controller. It is located on the top right-hand side. 2) Windows may not beset to send to the projector. There are buo ways to fix this: a) Hold down the "Windows" key and tap the up" key. This will open up a window on the right side of the screen i) Click "Duplicate" if the user wants the same screen on the computer and projector. ii) Click "Extend" if the user wants to use the projector as a second screen that has different information b) Double click on the "Display Switch Shortcut" icon on the Window background (it is hard to see as it is a clear icon). ](../../Attachments/Help-Desk-Projectors-image1.png){width="8.5in" height="11.0in"}
