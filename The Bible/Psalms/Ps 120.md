# Psalms 120

***


###### 1 
I call on the LORD in my distress, and he answers me. 

###### 2 
Save me, LORD, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues. 

###### 3 
What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue? 

###### 4 
He will punish you with a warrior's sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush. 

###### 5 
Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar! 

###### 6 
Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. 

###### 7 
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek. Copyright © 2019 by Zondervan.
